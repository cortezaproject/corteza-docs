:description: Learn how to USE {PRODUCT_NAME} duplicate detection to maintain clean and accurate data.

{PRODUCT_NAME} through the Duplicate detection feature helps maintain clean and accurate data by using matching rules to apply a criterion that determines how closely a field on a new or edited record matches the same field on an existing record.  

This is achieved through a customized user interface for handles duplicates: For example, block users from creating duplicates by displaying a warning and an error message.

=== Features

[Features and capabilities]
|=======================
|Feature |Description   | Level
|General Detection  |Any field can be opted in for duplicate detection by a toggle option in field configurator. A general duplicate detection rule will be applied on such selected fields.     |Field
|Detection Rule Definition |Multiple detection rules can be defined per Module, within compose module configurator    | Module
|Detection on Single Record|Duplicate detection on Record Create / Update. A default/custom message will be shown based on configurations and will be allowed/restricted record save based on configuration|Record Page
|Detection on All Records |Duplicate detection on all records of a selected module is an option available in all records page  to detect duplicates if any rules or fields are defined for duplicate detection.|All Records

=== Benefits of corteza duplicate detection

- To maintain data quality
- For improved accuracy and efficiency in data processing and generating information
- For effective description making
- For optimizing data storage requirements
- To minimize and manage errors

=== Enabling Duplication Detection on a Module.

Through validation, corteza ensures that no duplicate value is entered into the form for the designated field id when creating or editing a record.

Validation is set up using two rules; Strict duplicate value validation and Soft duplicate value validation.

* *Strict duplicate value validation*

A record will not be saved when a duplicate value is detected in the selected fields in any existing record of this Module. 

[NOTE]
====
When the Strict duplicate value validation rule is applied, an error message will be displayed on the screen's bottom right side, indicating that a record with the same name exists.
====

* *Soft duplicate value validation*

This rule allows the record will to be saved but issues out a warning when an duplicate value is detected that there is an existing record with the exact field values within the module.

[NOTE]
====
When Soft duplicate value validation is applied a warning message will be displayed on the bottom right side of the screen.
==== 

To enable the validation rules:

[NOTE]
====
Validations can enabled when creating new modules or on exiting modules.
====

1.Navigate to modules and create a new module.
2.Fill in the field mapping details and click the *[save]* button.
3.Navigate to the *[validation]* tab. It brings you to a new window which has two sections, namely; *Strict duplicate value validation *Soft duplicate value validation*

[IMPORTANT]
==== 
You can choose Strict duplicate value validation or Soft duplicate value validation when setting up the validation rule on a module.
====

4.On the Strict duplicate value validation section has two columns, one for *Available fields* on the left and the second for *Selected fields* on the right.

Click on the field under availble fields to select. Once a field is selected it moves to the left under the selected field column and vice-versa is true when unselecting the selected fields.

5.Soft duplicate value validation section has two columns, one for *Available fields* on the left and the second for *Selected fields* on the right.

Click on the specific field under *available fields* to select. 
Once a field is selected, it moves to the left under the *selected field* column, and vice-versa is true when unselecting the selected fields
