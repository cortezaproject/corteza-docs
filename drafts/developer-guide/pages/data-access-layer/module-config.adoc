. Click the data store tabs to setup the database connection and fill in the following requirements;

* Database Connection - click the dropdown to select the database from the list of available connections.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the connection will reset the sensitivity level configuration on the module and fields, if the sensitivity level is incompatible with the new connection
====

* Collection or database table name - Name of the database table or collection where records can be accessed and stored.

* Module field mapping and encoding - Configure how record fields are stored and read from the database. 

[NOTE]
====
Default behaviour is to encode values into JSON and store them in a single field. Alternatively you can use columns with the same name as the field name (Column) or use an Alias and store the value directly in the column
====

* System field mapping and encoding - System fields are used to store metadata about the record. Configure to skip or store them into a column with the same name (Column), a different column (Alias) or encode them into JSON.
