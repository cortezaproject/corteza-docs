= Data privacy

Data privacy allows us to configure and describe how and where sensitive data is stored on a module-field level.
It expands the current data storing capabilities and adds features that enable {PRODUCT_NAME} administrators to have more control over data privacy and managing private data.

=== Defining Privacy Policies.

With information from data sources set on a specific data module, each record will be able to hold detailed information about the ownership and location(s) of particular data. 
System Administrators will be obliged to provide a data storage location upon setting a Corteza data module. 
{PRODUCT_NAME} will enable the selection of predefined data policies or new policies to describe the processing purpose and rules at a record field level.
