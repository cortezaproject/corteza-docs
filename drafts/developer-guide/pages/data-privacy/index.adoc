= Data privacy

Data privacy allows us to configure and describe how and where sensitive data is stored on a module-field level.

It expands the current data storing capabilities and adds features that enable {PRODUCT_NAME} administrators to have more control over data privacy and managing private data.

=== *Defining Privacy Policies*.

With information from data sources set on a specific data module, each record will be able to hold detailed information about the ownership and location(s) of particular data. 

System Administrators will be obliged to provide a data storage location upon setting a Corteza data module. 

{PRODUCT_NAME} will enable the selection of predefined data policies or new policies to describe the processing purpose and rules at a record field level.

== Sensitivity Levels

{PRODUCT_NAME} allows users to classify data by categorizing data assets based on their information sensitivity. By classifying data, organizations can determine two key things:

Who should be authorized to access it?

What protection policies to apply when storing and transferring it.

There are  10 levels of data sensitivity with level 1 being the lowest and level 10 beng the highest.
You can specify sensitivity levels  limits when setting up a database connection or on modules.
Modules sensitivity levels rely on sensitivity level limit set at *connections*.

By specifying sensitivity level, the data becomes private which means only authorized users can access the data.

=== Setting up sensitivity levels

To set up sensitivity, navigate to system adminstration by clicking the *[Admin area]* card as shown in the screenshot below.

1. Click on *[sensitivity levels]*.
2. Click on *[New] button to add a new sensitivity level

3.Fill in the basic information.

4.Set the sensitivity level using the *level indicator*.

5.Add a description to describe the sensitivity level.

6.Click the *[submit]* button.

=== *Specifying sensitivity level on Modules*

You can specify the highest level of sensitivity allowed for fields within a module.

[CAUTION]
====
changing sensitivity level value  on  a module will reset the sensitivity level of fields within the module if they are incompatible.
====

To set up sensitivity level on modules, navigate to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance ( http://qc.cortezaproject.org/) and click the *Low Code application*.

.The screenshot indicates how to access the low code application.

* Highest allowed allowed sensitivity - this means you can specify new sensitivity level for fields within a module that is within the sensitivity level set during connection to the database. 
Click the *[dropdown]* to select sensitivity level

* Description box for sensitivity data usage disclosure(also visible on data-privacy-console).

6.Click the *[save]* button.

=== *Specifying sensitivity level on Module Field*
