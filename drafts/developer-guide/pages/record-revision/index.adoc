= Record revision extension

[NOTE]
====
This feature is among many capabilities of xref:data-access-layer/index.adoc[
data access layer(DAL)].
====

This extension provides revision support so that history is tracked through extending records and adding a “revision” system field that holds a number that increments every time record is updated.

All record changes are stored with an author and timestamp and can be accessed from the Compose.

== Compose record revisions

When enabled, all record operations are stored in the database.

{PRODUCT_NAME} keeps a revision counter for each record (starting from 1) that increments every time record is updated and only changes of record values are stored for each revision.
[NOTE]
====
A revision is only added when a record is updated, so newly created records don't have revisions. This intentionally reduces the number of revisions that need to be kept.
====

== Enabling Record Revisions.

Revision history can be enabled per compose module.
