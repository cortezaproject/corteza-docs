== List filtering & sorting

API endpoints for resource set/lists support filtering, sorting
and paging of resources.

=== Record filtering & sorting

Some limitations:
- searches only within a one module and within a one namespace
- has max limit of 100 records for perPage with 50 records as default

=== Syntax

SQL syntax should be used for filtering (`WHERE <filter>`) and sorting (`ORDER BY <sort>`).
API supports simple arithmetics (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), boolean (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) and comparison operators (<, >, =, <=, >=)


=== Sorting

All module fields are case-sensitive and can be used for filtering and sorting

.Record's system fields
- `ownedBy`,   user (ID) that owns this module
- `createdBy`, created by user (ID)
- `updatedBy`, updated by user (ID)
- `deletedBy`, deleted by user (ID)
- `createdAt`, created on (date + time)
- `updatedAt`, updated on (date + time)
- `deletedAt`, deleted on (date + time)

.Functions that can be used with the fields:
- `QUARTER(ts)`
- `YEAR(ts)`
- `DATE(ts)`
- `NOW(ts)`
- `DATE_ADD(ts)`
- `DATE_SUB(ts)`
- `DATE_FORMAT(ts)`

=== Sorting:

- `someField`,
order by someField, ascending
- `someField DESC`,
order by someField, descending
- `YEAR(someDate) DESC, someOtherField`,
order by descending by year and everything inside one year, ascending by someOtherField
