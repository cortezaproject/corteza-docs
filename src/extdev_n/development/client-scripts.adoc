= Client Scripts

Client scripts are automation scripts executed in the client's browser (user agent; UA).
Client scripts should be used when:

* interaction with the user is required,
* response latency is should be minimal,
* execution reliability is not important,
* we are not working with sensitive information such as authentication tokens or api credentials,
* automation script produces a light load on system resources.

== Example use cases

* prompt user to confirm form submission,
* validate or modify form's data before submission,
* redirect the user to another page; either in {product_name} {app_name_compose} or other,
* open an external resource inside a popup window.

== Trigger types

Client scripts support two types of triggers; **explicit** and **implicit**.

=== Explicit

Explicit triggers execute on a specific user invocation, such as a button press.
These include:

Manual::
    manual automation triggers are defined as buttons inside the user interface.
    They most commonly appear inside {app_name_compose} automation page blocks or inside {app_name_compose} record list toolbars.
    They are invoked and executed inside the UA.

=== Implicit

Implicit triggers execute as a collateral to another system event such as form submission.
These triggers include before/after events.
For a full list of available events refer to <<ext-resevt>>.
