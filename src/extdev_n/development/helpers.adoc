= Helper Classes

Helper classes consist of methods that greatly reduce the needed effort and the amount of required code to perform a specific operation, so it's recommended to use them as much as possible.
These classes are also context aware, meaning that the classes are able to determine some base parameters on their own, such as the current module, record and namespace.

[EXAMPLE]
====
Example of creating a new record with the help of `Compose` helper class (note how we don't need to specify the namespace):

[source,js]
----
Compose.makeRecord({ Title: 'Lead title' }, 'Lead')
  .then(myLead => Compose.saveRecord(myLead))
  .then(mySavedLead => {
    mySavedLead.recordID // saved recordID
  })
----
