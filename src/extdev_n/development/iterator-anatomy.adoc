= Automation Iterator Anatomy

To better understand the power of automation iterators and their definition, we define and describe their anatomy.

Automation iterator are constructed with the following methods:

`i`::
    Defines the resource, action and the filter used for resource fetching.
    Passed object must conform to the interface:

[source,typescript]
----
interface {
  resourceType: string; <1>
  eventType: 'onManual' | 'onInterval' | 'onTimestamp' = 'onManual'; <2>
  action: 'update' | 'delete' | 'clone' | '' = ''; <3>
  filter: IteratorFilter; <4>
}
----
<1> define the resource type; see <<ext-resevt>> for details.
<2> define the event type; see <<ext-resevt>> for details.
<3> define what action the script performs; see <<ext-dev-iteract>> for details,
<4> define the filter to use; see <<ext-dev-iteratorConstraints>> for details.

`i.at`::
    Defines that the automation script is executed at a specific time,

`i.every`::
    Defines the interval in which the automation script is executed,


[#ext-dev-iteract]
== Iterator actions

update::
    The result of the automation script will be used to update the original resource,

delete::
    The result of the automation script will be used to delete the original resource,

clone::
    The result of the automation script will be used to create a new resource with updated values; original resource is left un changed,

[IMPORTANT]
====
Iterator script doesn't perform any operation on the resource except if explicitly specified by the `action` property.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Iterator and trigger are not compatible; you can only use one or the other within the same automation script.

[#ext-dev-iteratorConstraints]
== Filter

Iterator filter provides ability to write query (conditions), sorting, limit and offset rules
It closely resembles {PRODUCT_NAME}'s filter object and conforms to the following interface:

[source,typescript]
----
interface {
  query: string; <1>
  sort: string; <2>
  limit: number | string; <3>
  offset: number | string; <4>
  [_: string]: number | string; <5>
}
----
<1> SQL like query filter to use (`WHERE <query>`).
<2> SQL like sort to use (`ORDER BY <sort>`).
<3> Maximum number of resource.
<4> Offset from first record.
<5> additional non-standard resource specific parameters.
