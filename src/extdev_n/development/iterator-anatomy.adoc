Automation iterators define the batch operation that will be executed at a given point in time or in a specified interval.

Automation iterator definition is performed with the following functions:


### Automation iterator anatomy

* defines constraints

* iterator construction functions:
** constructor:
*** resourceType - define what resource we will be working with
*** action - define action type (update, delete, clone, /)
*** filter - define the filter to use

** every:
*** defines interval to execute; eg. daily

** at:
*** defines timestamp to execute at; eg. new year eve

* 'onManual',
* 'onInterval',
* 'onTimestamp',

* filter - standard corteza filter object:
** query - SQL like query
** sort - SQL like sort condition
