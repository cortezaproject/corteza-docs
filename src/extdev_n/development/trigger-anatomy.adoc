`t.on`::
    @todo

`t.for`::
    defines the resource for the execution (eg. `compose:record`),

`t.where`::
    defines the constraints for the execution (eg. `t.where(module, 'Lead')`),

`t.before`::
    defines that the automation script is executed before a specific operation occurs,

`t.after`::
    defines that the automation script is executed after a specific operation occurs,

`t.at`::
    defines that the automation script is executed at a specific time,

`t.every`::
    defines the interval in which the automation script is executed,

`t.uiProp`::
    @todo...
