= Client Scripts

== File structure

For increased consistency across different types of user agents (different browsers, such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, ...) all client scripts are processed and bundled.

For a more intuitive bundle definition, size optimization and consistency, we define the following file structure:

[source,text]
----
src /
    client-scripts / <1>
        auth / <2>
            ... <7>

        admin / <3>
            ... <7>

        compose / <4>
            ... <7>

        messaging / <5>
            ... <7>

        shared / <6>
            ... <7>
----
<1> Root folder for all client scripts.
<2> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_auth}.
<3> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_admin}.
<4> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_compose}.
<5> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_messaging}.
<6> Reserved directory for any shared logic, such as custom libraries, assets, ...
<7> Undefined file structure; can be defined as needed.
