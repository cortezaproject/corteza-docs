= Client Scripts

Client scripts are processed and bundled by {app_automation}, served to the client by the {product_name} server and executed within the client's browser (UA).

Client scripts should be used when:

* interaction with the user is required,
* response latency is should be minimal,
* execution consistency is not as important,
* we are not working with sensitive information such as authentication tokens or api credentials,
* automation script produces a light load on system resources.
