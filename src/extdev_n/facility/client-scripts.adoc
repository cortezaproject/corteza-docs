= Client Scripts

== File structure

For increased consistency across different types of user agents (different browsers, such as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, ...) all client scripts are processed and bundled.

For a more intuitive bundle definition, size optimization and consistency, we define the following file structure:

[source,text]
----
/client-scripts <1>
    /auth <2>
        /... <7>

    /admin <3>
        /... <7>

    /compose <4>
        /... <7>

    /messaging <5>
        /... <7>

    /shared <6>
        /... <7>
----
<1> Root folder for all client scripts (under each search path).
<2> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_auth}.
<3> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_admin}.
<4> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_compose}.
<5> Defines a bundle for {product_name} {app_name_messaging}.
<6> Reserved directory for any shared logic, such as custom libraries, assets, ...
<7> Undefined file structure; can be defined as needed.

.Client-script path structure
[source]
----
<search-path>/client-scripts/<bundle>/<path-to-script>/*.js
