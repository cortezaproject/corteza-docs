= Iterators

Automation script iterators determine when, the execution context; the input and output of the automation script.

Iterators consist of 4 components:

Event type::
    Defines the event that should invoke the script's execution.
    See <<ext-resevt>> for available event types.

Resource type::
    Defines the resource that the automation script is compatible with.
    This also defines the execution context, input and output of the automation script.
    See <<ext-resevt>> for available resource types and their meta.

Action::
    Defines the action that the automation script would like to perform.

Filter::
    Defines the filter that determines the resources that should be processed by the automation script.
    Refer to <<ext-dev-iteratorConstraints>> for details.
