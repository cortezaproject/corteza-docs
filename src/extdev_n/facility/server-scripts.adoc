= Server Scripts

== File structure

Since server scripts are executed in the background on a capable machine, there is no need (at least not yet) for any inelegant grouping, so there is no need for any complicated file structuring.
We define the following file structure:

[source,text]
----
src /
    server-scripts / <1>
        ... <2>
----
<1> Root folder for all server scripts.
<2> Undefined file structure; can be defined as needed.
