= Server Scripts

Server scripts are processed, served and executed by {app_automation} server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{app_automation} server will never execute an automation script on it's own.
The execution must be invoked by the {product_name} server or manually via gRPC protocol.
====

Server scripts should be used when:

* interaction with the user is not required,
* response latency is not as important,
* execution consistency is important,
* automation script produces a heavy load on system resources
