= Server Scripts

== File structure

Since server scripts are executed in the background on a capable machine, there is no need (at least not yet) for any inelegant grouping, so there is no need for any complicated file structuring.
We define the following file structure:

[source,text]
----
/server-scripts <1>
    /... <2>
----
<1> Root folder for all server scripts (under each search path).
<2> Undefined file structure; can be defined as needed.

.Server-script path structure
[source]
----
<search-path>/server-scripts/<path-to-script>/*.js
----
