= User Agent

The second major part in our automation system is the user agent - UA (user's web browser).
UA is a front-end system responsible for automation script execution.
The system's main purpose is to provide the ability to interact with the user and implement custom user interfaces.

Since the automation script is executed in the user's browsers, they are considered less secure and should **not** work with any sensitive data such as authentication tokens, API credentials, ...

== main responsibilities
. fetch and register automation scripts provided by {product_name} server,
. register automation triggers on the event bus,
. execute automation scripts based on implicit/explicit events.

== security

For privacy and security reasons, UA automation scripts do not support custom security contexts, but they do support role based filtering.
