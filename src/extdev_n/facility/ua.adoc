= User Agent

The second major part in our automation system is the user agent - UA (user's web browser).
UA is a front-end system responsible for client automation script execution.
The system's purpose is to provide the ability to interact with the user from inside automation scripts.
In the near future it will also provide the ability to customize the entire user interface.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Since client scripts are executed in the browser, they are considered less secure.
These scripts should **not** work with any sensitive data such as authentication tokens, API credentials, personal data filtering, ...
