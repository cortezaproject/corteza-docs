=== Automation

An automation page block is designed to define an interface to the explicit automation scripts.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The payload provided to the automation script differs from where the automation page block is placed.
For example, if it's placed in a record page, then that record is included in the payload.
====

When selecting what automation the page block should show, you are able to specify a custom label and style.

[TIP]
====
Automation script not showing?
Make sure that:

* It compiled with no errors,
* you refreshed your page after it was included,
* the trigger defined a `.uiProp('app', 'compose')` constraint.
====

[TIP]
====
You can also use server side automation scripts, as long as they define an explicit automation trigger; for example:

```
triggers ({ on }) {
  return on('manual')
    .for('compose:record')
    .where('module', 'Lead')
    .where('namespace', 'crm')
    .uiProp('app', 'compose')
},
```
