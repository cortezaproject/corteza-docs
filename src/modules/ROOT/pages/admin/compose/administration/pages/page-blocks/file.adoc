=== File

A file page block is quite similar to the content page block in a way that is designed to display some content.
The only difference is, that it is designed to display a set of files instead of a text content.

This can be useful to handle files that are relevant to all resources in the system, such as a ToS, schedule, etc.

[NOTE]
====
If the file should differ based on the record, you have to define a module File field.
File page blocks are unable to display content relative to the context.
