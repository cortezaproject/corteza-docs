=== Record

Record page blocks are designed to allow access to the data inside each record, for either viewing or editing.

When defining a record page block, you select a set of fields that will be present in the given page block.
This allows you to customize the layout as much as you wish.
Group contact related information in one block, subscription related information in another block, and so on.

[TIP]
====
When selecting fields, you can rearrange these with an intuitive drag and drop interface.

Make sure that all required fields are accessible via the record page.
