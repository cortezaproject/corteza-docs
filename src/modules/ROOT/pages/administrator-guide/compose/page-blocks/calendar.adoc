=== Calendar

Calendar page block is designed to display a calendar along with a set of associated events.

The calendar supports a configurable set of views.
These include:

* Month view
* week view
* day view
* agenda view

An event source is defined as a module, where a record defines the date and time and the title of the event.

Calendar event sources also enable prefiltering, but it is important to notice, that they **do not** support value interpolation.
