= `2021.3`

{PRODUCT_NAME} `2021.3` improves the stability and security of the system; and a lot of new features including a visual automation builder (xref:integrator-guide:workflows/index.adoc[{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_WORKFLOW}]), support template management and rendering.
{PRODUCT_NAME} also introduces an authentication server that conforms to the https://oauth.net/2/[OAuth2] protocol, which increases security and increases flexibility when it comes to authentication options.

.[#2021_3-important]#<<2021_3-important,Important upgrade notes:>>#
* Authentication changed to the OAuth2 standard, and any authentication logic relying on the previous versions will no longer work.
* The {APP_AUTOMATION} server is now disabled by default.
Set the `CORREDOR_ENABLED=true` in your `.env` file if you wish to have it enabled.
* {PRODUCT_NAME} Messaging is now deprecated and removed.
