[#2021-9-x]
= `2021.9`

With {PRODUCT_NAME} `2021.9`, we continue to improve accessibility by introducing internationalization for the user interface as well as user-defined configurations.
In addition, we've improved the overall design and user experience, improved the authentication and access control facilities, expanded on the existing feature set, and introduced a few new additions.

*Internationalization*

With xref:integrator-guide:personalization/i18n.adoc[internationalization], we add support for the translation of user interfaces, as well as locale specific date-time and number formatting.
{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to modify the built-in translations entirely as well as define translations for additional languages you might need or any custom web application modifications you might have performed.
You can also translate most of the user-provided configurations (such as namespaces and module fields), allowing you to configure your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications to be accessible.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable translations for custom configuration, you will need to set the `LOCALE_RESOURCE_TRANSLATIONS_ENABLED=true` `.env` variable.
====

*UI/UX*

Building on the `2021.3` release, we continue to improve the user interface design as well as the overall experience when interacting with {PRODUCT_NAME} web applications.
Most notably, we've reworked page navigation, improved consistency between different web applications, and added a more granular record list filter.

*Access control*

The xref:integrator-guide:access-control.adoc[access control facility] received an upgrade, providing more fine-grained control over the access to your data, such as specific records or modules of particular namespaces.
xref:integrator-guide:access-control.adoc#role-type-ctx[Contextual roles] allow you to determine role membership and thus access to resources based on the xref:integrator-guide:access-control.adoc#role-type-ctx[state the system is in] (such as what record we are editing).

[TIP]
====
With contextual roles, you can cover cases where a user is only allowed to access or manage data created or owned by them.
====

*Authentication and security*


The authentication flow is now more flexible by introducing support for xref:integrator-guide:authentication/external/index.adoc#saml[SAML] and split credential flow.
Further improvements to the authentication token generator and handler help increase the stability and security of the system.

*Integration gateway*

Responding to the needs of defining custom API endpoints, we've expanded the sink route facility and introduced the xref:integrator-guide:api-gw/index.html[Integration gateway].
The improved facility simplifies the process of defining and managing custom API endpoints and defining processing for HTTP requests either via the built-in functions, workflows, or xref:integrator-guide:api-gw/index.adoc#js-processing[custom code].

[NOTE]
====
The legacy sink route facility is still present and works as it did before, but we aim to replace the sink routes.
====

*Reporter*

xref:integrator-guide:reporting/index.adoc[The reporter] provides a dedicated facility to define and view reports based on the data your {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} defines.

{PRODUCT_NAME} 2021.9 reworks the internals of our RBAC facility.
From the access evaluation flow, to how rules are encoded.

.When upgrading to `2021.9`:
* {PRODUCT_NAME} will automatically scan all existing RBAC rules, remove any obsolete rules like messaging, sanitize existing (federation module renaming) and properly change change resource IDs.
* {PRODUCT_NAME} will automatically upgrade, add, remove, and rename roles as needed based on the reworked system:
** authenticated, anonymous, super admin roles are added,
** `everyone` role is *removed*
** all RBAC rules owned by the now deprecated `everyone` role are migrated to the role `authenticated`
** static role IDs (1 for everyone and 2 for admin) are replaced by sequential IDs.
All memberships and RBAC rules are transferred to the updated role IDs.
* {PRODUCT_NAME} will automatically add the following system users:
** Corteza Provisioner (`provision@corteza.local`, `corteza-provisioner`); member of super admin account, used for all provisioning actions.
** Corteza Service Account  (`service@corteza.local`, `corteza-service`); member of super admin account, used for all service activities, CLI interface.
** Corteza Federation (`federation@corteza.local`, `corteza-federation`); member of super admin account, used for all federation activities.
