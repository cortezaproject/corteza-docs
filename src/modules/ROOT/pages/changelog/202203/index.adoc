With {PRODUCT_NAME} `2022.3`, we continue to improve system stability, security, performance, as well as introducing new setup and development quality-of-life improvements.
In addition we introduce the new {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_DISCOVERY} and Integration gateway profiler.

xref:2022.3@integrator-guide:discovery/index.adoc[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_DISCOVERY}*]

xref:2022.3@integrator-guide:discovery/index.adoc[] provides a powerful search engine to interact with your data with an intuitive user interface to search and, for some cases, visualize the data such as geographical metadata.

*{PRODUCT_NAME} configuration UX improvements*

To make {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} app configuration process simpler, we introduce a few quality of life tweaks such as workflow step configuration preview tooltips, additional workflow help tooltips and labels, workflow step label suggestions, and delete strategy for pages with sub-pages.

In addition, we introduce the integration gateway xref:2022.3@integrator-guide:api-gw/profiler.adoc[route profiler] to help you benchmark the system and help with automation troubleshooting and optimization.

*{PRODUCT_NAME} deployment UX improvements*

To simplify initial {PRODUCT_NAME} deployment troubleshooting steps, we introduce xref:2022.3@devops-guide:troubleshooting/web-console.adoc[].
The web console allows you to quickly access system logs, health checks, and other parameters you may need to debug a faulty instance.

[TIP]
====
The web console is most useful for scenarios where you may not have (or want to give) direct access to your servers.
