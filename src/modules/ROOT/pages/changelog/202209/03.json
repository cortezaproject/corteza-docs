  "added": [
    {
      "what": [
        "a new label position option for charts with y-axis.",
        "It enables you to position the label at the bottom, middle or top of the y-axis."
      ],
      "why": [
        "because the y-axis label was overlapping with the values if they were bigger."
      ],
      "refs": [
        "https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza/commit/18248a2376ec4400ac562faae32be3ec129acca1"

    },
    {
      "what": [
        "new multi value filter operators (`IN` and `NOT IN`) to the pre-filter in the reporter UI.",
        "This why users have the ability to filter records using multi value fields."
      ],
      "why": [
        "to bring back the support to filter records using their multi value fields inside reports."

      ]
    },
    {
      "what": [
        "additional configuration for pie, bar, line, and doughnut charts.",
        "Three new sections were added - tooltip, legend and offset as well as the options to rotate x and y axis labels (only for bar and line charts)."
      ],
      "why": [
        "to give the users more freedom to customize charts."

  "changed": [
    {
      "what": [
        "the resource list now uses the same component, item count and pagination and it is also enabled for resource lists that support it.",
        "Now almost on every resource we show the total item count and we have the ability to go to the next page if there are items."
      ],
      "why": [
        "because the look and feel of lists across {PRODUCT_NAME} needed to be unified.",
        "Also for better user experience and to always know the correct number of how many records/items we have."
      ],
      "how": [
        "by updating and using the reusable CResourceList component in corteza-vue.",
        "That means we can control the look of all lists from one place."

      "what": [

        "The change is applied in compose, admin, reporter, and workflow."
      ],
      "why": [
        "because providing a handle shouldn't be a necessity and resources should have the option to omit it."
