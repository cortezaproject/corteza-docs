    {
      "what": [
        "support for casting numbers to float inside workflow expressions via the float function."
      ],
      "why": [
        "to simplify type casting by using a function instead of an intermediate workflow expression variable."

  "changed": [
    {
      "what": [
        "making name property required when creating templates, dal connections, workflows, auth clients and sensitivity levels."
      ],
      "why": [
        "because we were able to create a resource without any data entered, and with this change now we have a requirement and you cannot create a resource without data entered."
      ],
      "how": [
        "by adding validations to prevent creating one of the listed resources without adding a name."

    {
      "what": [
        "the usage of chart.js on admin dashboard with e-charts."
      ],
      "why": [
        "to remove all places where we used to use chart.js since we transitioned to apache e-charts."
      ],
      "how": [
        "The chart is now in line with other charts in {PRODUCT_NAME}, the date tooltips are now also correctly displayed."

    {
      "what": [
        "the record organizer now gets filtered based on the key field and key value."

        "to avoid putting the knowledge on how to set up the pre-filter and make the record organizer work on the user."
