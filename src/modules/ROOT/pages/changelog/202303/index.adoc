= `2023.3`

With {PRODUCT_NAME} `2023.3`, we continue to improve system stability, security, performance, as well as focusing on improving our user interfaces to make {PRODUCT_NAME} more enjoyable to both use and configure.

*Page Layouts*

*Page layouts* enable you to dynamically change the contents based on who is viewing what from where.

You can define an arbitrary number and sequence of page layouts, providing more flexibility to customize the experience of your end-users.
In addition to changing the layout when the user visits the page, you can also define their relation and allow users to navigate between them.

*Conditional Fields*

*Conditional fields* enable you to dynamically hide bits of information based on the contents of the page.
This enables you to simplify your user interfaces and hide irrelevant information.

*New Page Blocks*

* *Navigation* page block allows you to define custom navigation inside your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} applications.
The navigation can be an addition to the pre-defined one or a complete replacement.
* *Tabbed* page block allows you to _pack_ multiple page blocks into a single one, _hidden_ behind tabs.
The tabbed page block enables you to condense user interfaces by _hiding_ common bits of information behind the same page block.

*UI Touchups*

User interfaces were a big focus for the `2023.3` release; improving user experience when configuring and interacting with your application, as well as laying the groundwork for future releases.
