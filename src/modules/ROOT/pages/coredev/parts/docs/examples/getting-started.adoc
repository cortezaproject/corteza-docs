= Getting Started

== Sample Feature

For an easier representation, we use the following feature specification:

include::sample-feature.adoc[]

- specify a set of bullets (section) that outline the important parts of the system

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
- security
- front-end
- backend
- repository
----

- expend on each of the sections with additional important bits that should be mentioned

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
- security
  - available permissions
  - the scope of each permission
  - guidelines
- front-end
  - important libraries used
  - browser compatibility
  - used algorithms
  - communication with the backend
- backend
  - access control
  - used algorithms
  - limitations such as throttling
- repository
  - tables, fields and their types
----

- go over all the bullets from start to finish and expand those as you think best fits.
Don't worry if the first version doesn't feel right, we will get there!

For example:

[source,adoc]
----
= Monitor

This feature implements a system that monitors the clients connected to the {PRODUCT_NAME} Monitor core system.
Reports statistics.

== Security

=== Available permissions

Monitor log::
    The permission allows the role to create a log entry for the Monitor system.
    We should only grant this permission to the users that we want to know about,

Monitor list::
    The permission allows the role to access the stored Monitor data.
    Such users can analyse the data to create reports,

Monitor log delete::
    The permission allows the role to remove a log entry from the monitor system.
    Be careful with this one, as we don't want users to needlessly remove information.

...

[NOTE]
====
The above example's wording is not the best and should be improved with additional iterations.
Also note, that we've merged multiple security subsections (available permissions, scope and guidelines) into one to create a more condensed outline.
