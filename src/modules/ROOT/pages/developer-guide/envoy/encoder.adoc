= Source Encoder

The *resource encoding* layer takes in xref:ROOT:developer-guide/envoy/resources.adoc[*resources structures*] and encodes them to *different destinations* (such as the store layer).

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only the store encoder is pre-defined.
Other encoders (YAML, JSON, and CSV) are on their way.
====

The resource encoding can be used to *save data to the store layer*, *export the data to the YAML file*, *convert a JSON file to a YAML file*, and any other case you might wish to have.

| The *Store encoder* knows how to store the provider resources into the store layer.

The store layer defines a *series of intermediate state* structures that are used to *hold contextual information* such as the resource's ID and any references.
State structures let us trivially perform create/update tasks and resolve dependent resource ID.
