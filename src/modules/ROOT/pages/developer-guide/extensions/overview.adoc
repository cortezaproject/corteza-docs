= Overview

== Components

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_AUTOMATION} Server::
    A Node.js service written in TypeScript.
    It is the heart of the system as it parses and serves automation scripts.
    It also executes server-scripts.

{PRODUCT_NAME} Server::
    The {PRODUCT_NAME} server is responsible for automation script execution.
    On its own, {APP_AUTOMATION} server is unable to do any code execution; it must be invoked either via {PRODUCT_NAME} server or manually via gRCP protocol.

{APP_AUTOMATION} Client::
    Each {PRODUCT_NAME} webapp that allows client-script execution implements this.
    The {APP_AUTOMATION} Client is responsible for client-script registration and their execution.
    Automation scripts are received from the {PRODUCT_NAME} Server.
