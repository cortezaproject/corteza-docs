= Modules

A *module stores and shapes* your data (*records*) for a *given namespace*.
The data from `namespace A` *can not* be referenced by `namespace B`.

[TIP]
====
.Relational database correlation:
* module ~= *table*
* module field ~= *attribute*
* record ~= *entity*
====

[TIP]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} supports *multi-value fields*, which removes the need of simple _pivot_ tables.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When exporting *multi-value fields* into the *CSV format*, only the *first value* is exported.
====

== Module definition guidelines

Module name::
    The module name should be in *PascalCase* with spaces allowed, it should be *short* and *descriptive*, with *no special characters* except for `:` (colon), `-` (dash), `_` (underscore), `/` (forward slash) and `\` (backwards slash).

Module handle::
    The module handle should be in *snake_case*, it should be *short* and *descriptive*, with *no special* characters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.The provided handle must:
include::ROOT:partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]
====

== Module field definition guidelines

Field name::
    The module field name should be in *snake_case*, it should be *short* and *descriptive*, with *no special characters*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.The provided name must:
include::ROOT:partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]
====

Field title::
    The maximum module field *title length* is *64 characters*.
    There are no other restrictions.

Type::
    The module *field type* defines the *type of the stored data*.
    Make sure to *use appropriate types*.

== Create a module

.To create a new module:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page and enter the namespace you wish to edit,
. click on the "Admin panel" in the top right corner,
. navigate to the "Modules" subpage,
. enter the module name and press the "Create" button,
. provide the module handle and save the changes.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only define permissions for existing modules.
====

== Importing modules

[IMPORTANT]
====
The current module importing system is unable to resolve *relations between different modules* via record fields.
References must be *fixed manually* after the system finishes *with the import*.
====

[NOTE]
====
Currently, only the JSON format is supported.
====

.To import modules:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page and enter the namespace you wish to edit,

. find the "Import module(s)" section on the top of the page,
. click on the "Browse" button and select the JSON file containing module definitions,
. click on the "Import" button,
. select on the modules you wish to import and press the "Import" button.

== Editing module fields

[IMPORTANT]
====
If the module *contains records*, the editing *interface is limited*.
If you wish to change the *disabled properties*, we suggest you create a *new field* instead.
====

.To edit an existing field:

[#compose-module-field-properties]
== Module field properties

Name::
    *The name for the field* defines how the values are stored.
    If you don't provide a title, the field name is used as the title.

[IMPORTANT]
====
.The provided name must:
include::ROOT:partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]
====

Title::
    *A human-friendly field title* shown when interacting with the data.
    It should be *short*, *descriptive* and *limited to 64 characters*.
    No other restrictions apply.

Type::
    The module *field type* defines the *type of the stored data*.
    Make sure to *use the appropriate type*.

Multi value:: 
    *Multi value fields* allow you to store *multiple entries* under the *same field*.
    This removes the need for simple _pivot tables_.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When exporting *multi-value fields* into the *CSV format*, only the *first value* is exported.
====

Required::
    *The required flag* makes the field *mandatory* for the end-user when creating or editing a record.

Private::
    *The private flag* marks the data as *sensitive*; such as name, email, or telephone number.
    This helps make your namespace *compliant with privacy regulations*, such as GDPR.

[#compose-module-field-expressions]
== Module field expressions

*Module field expressions* let you define *value expressions* (formula fields), *custom sanitizers*, and *custom validators*.

[TIP]
====
Use *value expressions* instead of automation scripts *when you need simple calculations*.
It is *much faster* and *simpler to maintain*.
====

[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#field-expr-value-expr]#<<field-expr-value-expr,Value expressions>>#
| Value expressions *calculate the field value* based on the rest of the field values.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, you can only use values *of the current record*.
References are not yet supported.
====

If the value expression *evaluation results in an error*, the errors are appended to the *field error set* (in the *web application* they are shown *under the field*).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use the <<field-expr-validators,custom validators>> for value validation.
====

If your field is a *multi-value field*, you need to return *an array of items*.

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
* `old`: record object with old values (empty when creating).
* `new`: record object with current field values.
* `<field-name>`: a string or array of strings with current field values.

If *field name collides with* (they have the same name) any of *reserved variables* you can access them via `old.values.<field-name>`.

.Example expression that calculates the price with tax:
[source]
----
price * 1.25
----

.Example expression that generates a full name:
[source]
----
trim(firstName + " " + lastName)
----

.Example of a multi-value expression evaluation:
[source]
----
["foo", "bar", "baz"]
----

| [#field-expr-sanitizers]#<<field-expr-sanitizers,Sanitizers>>#
| Sanitizers *modify the field value* to cleanup (sanitize) the data before it is saved.

If the sanitizer *evaluation results in an error*, the error is logged in the action log.

If you define *multiple sanitizers*, they are *run in the defined order*.

.Example sanitizer that limits the text length:
[source]
----
length(value) > 5 ? substr(value, 0, 5) + "..." : value
----

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
* `value`: the current field value.

| [#field-expr-validators]#<<field-expr-validators,Validators>>#
| Validators *validate the field value* by *raising errors* when the value is not valid.
Validators *can not change the value*.

*Built-in field validators* can be disabled; *required and unique-multi-value validators* can not be disabled.

If you define *multiple validators*, they are *run in the defined order*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The field validation step errors out when *first error occurs*.

If we define validators `A`, `B`, and `C`, and the validator `A` raises an error; validators `B` and `C` are not evaluated.
====

.Validation expressions are not executed when:
* the value is not changed,
* the value is missing.

[TIP]
====
Use the required flag to check for required values.
====

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
* `value`: the current field value,
* `oldValue`: the old field value,
* `values`: all current field values (`values.<field-name>`).

.Example validator to check the text length:
[source]
----
length(title) < 5
----
