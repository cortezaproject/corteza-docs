When specifying what buttons to show, you are also able to set *the label* and the *button variant*.

[TIP]
====
.If you can't see your automation scripts:
* make sure there were no compilation errors,
* you refreshed your page after you've added the scripts,
* the trigger defined a `.uiProp('app', 'compose')` constraint.
