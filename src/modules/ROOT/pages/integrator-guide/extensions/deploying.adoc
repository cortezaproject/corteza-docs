= Deploying extensions

== Setting up

*To use the extension*, it must be available to the {APP_AUTOMATION} server, either locally or on the server.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you are running the *{APP_AUTOMATION} without Docker* (from source code), you can skip any *Docker related steps*.
====

.We'll assume that:
* your *current working directory* is where your *extension is*,
* your *server deploy directory* is `/opt/deploy/test-project`,
* your *file structure* looks like this (where your {PRODUCT_NAME} is running):

[source,txt]
----
data/
docker-compose.yml
.env
----

.To use the extension:
. *Create a new directory for the extension*; we'll name it `corredor`, but the name doesn't matter.
. Somehow *transport the extension source files* into the newly created directory (see below sections for tips).
. Add a *new volume* to the `docker-compose.yaml` file that will *contain the extension*.
For example, under the `corredor` service, `volumes: [ "./corredor/test-extension:/corredor/test-extension", ...other volumes you might have... ]`
. Edit the `.env` (`CORREDOR_EXT_SEARCH_PATHS` variable) file to *register the new extension*.
For example `CORREDOR_EXT_SEARCH_PATHS=/extensions:/extensions/*:/corredor/test-extension`.
. *Reload the configurations* (`docker-compose up -d`).

At the end, your file structure should look like this:
[source,txt]
----
data/
docker-compose.yml
.env
corredor/
  test-extension/
    server-scripts/
      /...
    client-scripts/
      /...
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
`CORREDOR_EXT_SEARCH_PATHS` can contain *multiple paths* separated by *colon* (`:`).
====

[TIP]
====
You can use `docker-compose logs -t --tail 100 -f corredor` to see if the extension was registered and processed correctly.
====

== Upload using git

If you are using *git and a repository*, we suggest you use that.
*Clone* the repository *onto your server* (into the volume mentioned above).
You can then *pull the changes* whenever the source code changes.

[NOTE]
====
If it is a *private repository*, make sure that your *git client* on your server *has access* to it.
====

== Upload manually

You can use `scp`, `rsync`, or any other client.
*Upload* the extension's source *into the volume* mentioned above.

[NOTE]
====
I usually use `rsync` as it makes things a bit easier.
====

[TIP]
====
An example `rsync` command *following the above assumptions*; make sure to *change the parameters*:

`rsync -av -e ssh --exclude="node_modules/*" ./* SSH_USERNAME_HERE@ssh.remote.tld:/opt/deploy/test-project/corredor --delete;`
