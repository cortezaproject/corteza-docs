= {PRODUCT_NAME} Envoy

== Overview

*{PRODUCT_NAME} Envoy* (later referred to as *envoy*) is a *framework* to simplify the *manipulation* of arbitrary *complex data*.
The framework can work with *linear acyclic data* (no relationships between the bits); as well as with *complex cyclic data* (relationships between the bits).

We rely on the envoy framework whenever we wish to perform any *data transportation/manipulation* from one form to another.
It is mainly used for data *import*, *export*, and xref:ROOT:rfc/federation/index.adoc[*federation*].

[NOTE]
====
The core nature of the problem we are addressing is perfect for our good ol' friend graph theory; so we will _mostly_ follow those rules.
We go into some theoretical bits later in the <<layer-graph,graph>> section.
====

The framework defines a *series of layers* with well defined, *simple interfaces* that can be *easily customized*, *exchanged* or outright *removed* if not needed.
The layered structure makes the framework flexible and relatively trivial to use anywhere in our system.

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the diagram for a visual representation of the *layers*, how they *connect* and how the *data flows*.
====

.The main layers are:
* *<<layer-decoder,The decoder layer>>* converts *input sources* into *internal structures* that are understandable by underlying layers.
* *<<layer-preproc,The pre-process layer>>* performs some *initial operations* to prepare the data for its journey.
* *<<layer-validator,The validator layer>>* validates the provided *data* as well as the *operations* we wish to perform, such as field mapping and source joining.
* *<<layer-graph,The graph layer>>* helps us determine the *processing order*, keeping in mind the *dependency constraints* put in place by the resource nodes.
* *<<layer-encoder,The encoding layer>>* converts *internal structures* into some *output form* we wish to have.

[TIP]
====
We can also do some fun bits like converting YAML files into JSON files.
