= Graph layer

The graph layer helps us determine the *processing order*, keeping in mind the *dependency constraints* put in place by the resource nodes.

== Graph nodes

A graph node is any structure that conforms to the `envoy.Node` interface:

[source,go]
----
Node interface {
  // Matches checks if the node matches the given resources and **any** of the identifiers.
  Matches(resource string, identifiers ...string) bool

  // Identifiers returns a set of values that identify the node.
  //
  // The identifiers may **not** be unique across all resources, but
  // they **must** be unique inside a given resource.
  Identifiers() NodeIdentifiers

  // Resource returns the Corteza resource identifier that this node handles
  Resource() string

  // Relations returns a set of NodeRelationships regarding this node
  //
  // The graph layer **must** be able to handle dynamic relationships (changed in runtime).
  Relations() NodeRelationships
}
----

The specific node implementation is up to the developer discretion. Still, it should *specify it's dependencies*, how we can *identify the node* and a way of checking if the two *nodes match*.

The intermediate resource node is mainly responsible for *dependency resolution* and *data preparation* for the processing layers.
A node shouldn't have much complex logic out of the dependency management context.

== Graph

In this context, since we are addressing issues regarding dependencies, the *_directed_ graph* data structure is the perfect match.
*But*, this isn't a regular graph.

Our implementation is calculated *on-the-fly* (at runtime) and isn't (entirely) based on pointers like we would usually do.
We've decided on this approach to significantly *simplify the underlying logic* required by the *graph structure* and the *node structures* that shape the graph.
This approach also gives us *more flexibility* in regards to runtime graph modifications.

[NOTE]
====
The #1 reason why we decided on this approach is simplicity.
The more straightforward graph logic and node relationship management allow us to change dependencies while processing the graph trivially.
====

[NOTE]
====
Since the envoy is designed for use with *larger*, more *complex* data operations, this on-the-fly calculation is practically free.
====

[TIP]
====
The simple graph interface allows us to define multiple different implementations.
Anything from a *simple linear graph*, to a _more efficient_ *pointer-based graph*.
As long as the interfaces remain the same, there should be no issues.
