= Authentication

This section covers all parts related to authentication and other security related concerns when working with federated nodes and their data.

== Pairing

In order for two nodes to establish a federated network, they need to be paired.
The pairing process consists of two parts:

. Identification,
. handshake.

Refer to the below schema for an overview over the entire flow:

=== Identification

Firstly we need to let nodes A and B know about each others existence by following the flow of:

Node A creates a new node and generates a pair URI::
    This is a URI in the form of `corteza://<nodeID(A)>:<token>@<api-url(A)>?name=<name>` that lets node B know how to connect to node A.

[NOTE]
====
`token` is a generated OTT token that gives us a basic way of authenticating the initial requests that are performed outside of the authentication facility.
====

Node A admin sends the URI to node B admin::
    This step has to be done manually by the admin and they should use a secure channel in order to exchange this information.

Node B admin inserts the pair URI into the UI::
    This step registers node A on the other side.
    Now both nodes know about each others existence but they are not yet able to communicate.

=== Handshake

Lastly, we need to securely exchange the credentials so the two nodes can communicate, with the following flow:

Node B admin initializes the handshake process::
    This creates a federated system user along with a role and an authentication JWT(B) token.

[NOTE]
====
The use of system users and roles allows us to use the already existing authentication and access control facility.
====

Node B sends a handshake request to node A::
    Since this step is performed outside the authentication facility (since node B is not yet authenticated), this step must be confirmed by the node A administrator.
    An initial security step here is the check against the token, generated in the node pair URI.

Node A administrator confirms the handshake request::
    This creates a federated system user along with a role and an authentication JWT(A) token.

[NOTE]
====
The use of system users and roles allows us to use the already existing authentication and access control facility.
====

Node A completes the handshake with node B::
    Lastly, node A sends their JWT(A) token to node B, using JWT(B) as the means of authentication.
