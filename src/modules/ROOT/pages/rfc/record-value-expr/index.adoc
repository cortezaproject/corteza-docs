= Record Value Expressions

Record Value Expressions enables support for expressions to record values and unlock:

 - formula fields
 - custom sanitizers
 - custom validators
 - custom formatting

Introduction of expressions greatly simplifies solutions that required implementation through automation script.
It brings execution closer to core and within the same process, reducing overhead and improving stability and performance.

Library https://github.com/PaesslerAG/gval[gval] is used for parsing and evaluation of expression.
This allows to reuse validators and sanitizers on front-end in JavaScript environment.

== Formula field

Formula fields allow dynamic calculation of record values from constants and other values.
Only constants and values from current objects are supported.

.Example expression for formula field that calculates price with tax:
[source]
----
price * 1.25
----

This expression assumes there is another field named `price` in record values and multiplies that field with 1.25.

.Example expression for formula field that concatinates 2 string fields
[source]
----
trim(firstName + " " + lastName)
----

Expression assumes 2 other fields (firstName and lastName) and concatenates them with space between.
Finally, we trim the result to ensure there result is not prefixed or suffixed with a space in case any of the two fields are empty.

_Later upgrades will allow calculation from referenced records with dependency tracking and cascading updates._

#TBD# How to handle formula change on existing data.

== Sanitizers

Sanitizers aid in record value processing and *cannot raise errors* but *can modify value*.
Each module field can have one or more defined expression with accompanying description or explanation.

.Example of length control
[source]
----
length(title) > 5 ? substr(title, 0, 5) + "..." : title
----


Expressions are ran *before* built-in sanitizers. Built-in sanitizers cannot be disabled.
When multiple sanitization expressions are defined they are all ran sequentially in defined order.

Corteza logs all modifications to sanitizators.

#TBD Explicit logging could be enabled to catch all sanitized data (where input value differs from final one) for a particular expression"

== Validators

Validators aid in record value processing, *can raise errors* in case of invalid values but *cannot change values*.
Each module field can have one or more validation groups that consist of validation expression and  error message.
Built-in field validators can be disabled.

.Example of length control
[source]
----
length(title) < 5
----

When multiple validation expressions are defined they are all ran sequentially in defined order.
Custom validators are ran *after* or *instead* of built-in field-type validators.
Note that validation can produce multiple errors from different fields but each value is validated only until first error (or success).

Corteza logs all modifications to validators.

#TBD Explicit logging could be enabled to catch and log errors for a expression#

== Formatters

When record values are prepared for output Corteza formats each one according to field type and custom formatters.
Formatters *can reformat value* before they are outputed but *cannot raise errors or change them*.
Each module field can have one or more formatter expression.

Custom formatters are executed *after* or *instead* of built-on formatters.


.Example of custom formatting
[source]
----
capitalize(title)
----

== Expression functions (wip)

| length(arg)
| Returns length of the string

| toUpperCase(arg)
| Returns string, all letters capitalized

| toLowerCase(arg)
| Returns string, all letters in lower case

| toLowerCase(arg)
| Returns string, all letters in lower case

| longest(arg1, ... argN)
| Returns the longest string from list of argument

| shortest(arg1, ... argN)
| Returns the shortest string from list of argument

| max(arg1, ... argN)
| Returns the greatest number or date from list of arguments

| min(arg1, ... argN)
| Returns the lowest number or date from list of arguments

| coalesce(arg1, ... argN)
