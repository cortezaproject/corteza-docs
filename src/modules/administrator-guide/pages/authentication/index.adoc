== Auth client

The menu:system[auth clients] user interface allows you to inspect and manage your auth clients.

.Authentication grant types:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#auth-client-grant-authorization-code]#<<auth-client-grant-authorization-code,Authorization code>>#
|
The *authorization code* grant type is used to authenticate users with the classic OAuth2 flow.

To enable the grant type, select the "will be used to authenticate users (grant type = authorization_code)" option.

| [#auth-client-grant-client-credentials]#<<auth-client-grant-client-credentials,Client credentials>>#
|
The *client credentials* grant type is the simplified authentication flow, normally used to authenticate machines, such as external services or applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Client credentials grant type requires you to populate the "impersonate user" option.
The impersonated user will be used to create the security context of the JWT token.
====

To enable the grant type, select the "will be used to authenticate machines (grant type = client_credentials)" option.
