= Email settings

The email settings interface allows you to configure SMTP servers for sending emails from {PRODUCT_NAME}.

Please consult your email services provider for SMTP server information (host, port, user, password).

In case of any TLS/certificate issues you can adjust server name for the TLS check or disable checking and allow use of invalid certificates

[IMPORTANT]
====
Initial settings are copied from the `SMTP_*` environmental variables.
Corteza will log a warning if you keep the environmental variables and make changes to either variables or settings.
