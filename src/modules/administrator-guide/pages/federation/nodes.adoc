= Federated Nodes

A *federated node* is a *{PRODUCT_NAME} instance* (server) with the {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} feature enabled.
//Editor's note: what is a federated node? And a node for that matter? It may not be a thing everyone is familiar with.

A node can *expose data to its destination nodes* (acts as an origin), or *consume shared data from its origin nodes* (acts as a destination).

[NOTE]
====
A node can be both *the origin and a destination*.
====

Before we can exchange any data between the nodes, they need to go through the <<node-pairing,node pairing>> process.

[#node-pairing]
== Node pairing

.Node pairing flow outline:
. the origin node <<node-pairing-register,registers a destination node>>,
. the origin node <<node-pairing-invite,sends an invite>> to the destination node,
. the destination node accepts the invite, either <<node-pairing-accept-invite,via email>> or <<node-pairing-accept-invite-manual,via some other channel>>,
. the origin node <<node-pairing-handshake-accept,accepts the handshake request>> sent by the destination node.

[NOTE]
====
You can start the node pairing process from any node.

//Editor's note: Do you need to say this both here and in 56? If there isn't any particular need, I suggest you keep this one and delete the 56-59.

. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Nodes" under "Federation" in the navigation drawer,
