= Administrator Guide

The administrator guided covers the process of performing administration tasks such as defining roles and role membership, configuring your security model, and monitoring the system.

This page provides a general overview of the two web applications involved in {PRODUCT_NAME} administration -- <<webapp-admin,{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}>> and <<webapp-compose,{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}>>.
Specific topics are available in the side navigation under the *administrator guide*.

If you haven't yet setup your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance, refer to the xref:devops-guide:index.adoc[].

If you want to learn about low-code application development, refer to the xref:integrator-guide:index.adoc[].

[#webapp-admin]
== {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}

The {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application provides a user interface to perform general system-wide administration tasks such as creating roles, managing role membership, and monitoring the system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need sufficient permissions to access the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application.
====

.The main administration tasks performed from the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web applications include:
* xref:users.adoc[user] and xref:roles.adoc[role] management,
* security model adjustments by managing xref:authentication/index.adoc[authentication] and xref:access-control/index.adoc[access control],
* inspecting xref:logging.adoc[log] and xref:automation.adoc[automation] contents to identify and solve configuration issues.

To access the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application, go to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance and click on the admin area application.

[#webapp-compose]
== {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}

The {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} web application -- from the administrator's perspective -- provides a user interface for managing access control permissions for general web application usage as well as specific low-code applications.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need sufficient permissions to access {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} administration user interfaces.
====

*@todo* pointers to core features

To access the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} web application, go to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance and click on the {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} application.

image::corteza-one-app-selector.png[role="data-zoomable"]

After clicking on the application, you are presented with the web application's home page -- the list of all namespaces.

image::webapp-compose-homepage.png[role="data-zoomable"]

From the home page (the list of all namespaces) you can manage general access control, such as what role is allowed to create namespaces and what roles are allowed to access specific namespaces.

Click on the btn:[permissions] button on the top of the list to see all of the available access control rules.

image::webapp-compose-homepage.png[role="data-zoomable"]

To perform administration tasks for a specific low-code application, click on the btn:[visit namespace] button on the namespace you wish to manage, expand the left navigation sidebar, and click on the btn:[admin panel] button.

image::webapp-compose-app-homepage.png[role="data-zoomable"]

From the {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} admin panel you can manage access control permissions for resources defined by the namespace, such as who can edit modules, create records, and edit charts.

[NOTE]
====
The administrator guide doesn't touch low-code app configuration.
Refer to the xref:integrator-guide:index.adoc[] for details on configuring your own low-code application.

== System settings

The majority of system configuration which affects how the system behaves is performed on the deployment-level.

Refer to the xref:devops-guide:index.adoc[] for details.

=== User interfaces

The role management user interface resides in the xref:index.adoc#webapp-admin[{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}] web application, under:

* menu:system[settings]
* menu:system[email settings]
* menu:compose[settings]
* menu:user interface[settings]
