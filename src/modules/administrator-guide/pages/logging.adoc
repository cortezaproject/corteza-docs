= Logging

{PRODUCT_NAME} logs most of the operations that have occurred in the system in the *action log*.
The *action log* user interface provides an overview of events such as users that have registered or logged in, records that have been created, and templates that have been rendered.

[TIP]
====
Errors reported by the {APP_AUTOMATION} server are also visible in the action log.
====

You can use the action log for debugging and detecting suspicious behavior as it provides a rich insight into that has occurred.

== The action log interface

The action log user interface resides in the xref:index.adoc#webapp-admin[{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}] web application, under menu:system[action log].
