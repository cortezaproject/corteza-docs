= Messagebus

The messagebus feature allows the *producer* instance to offload some work to a *consumer* instance via message queues.
Message bus is primarily designed to be used with workflows, but it can be extended to work elsewhere.

[CAUTION]
====
*DevNote*: the following content is under construction and needs a lot more work.
====

.A messaging queue is valid if:
* has defined a name
* has defined consumer

== Queue consumers

Messaging queues are described with a producer-consumer pair.

.{PRODUCT_NAME} currently supports the following consumers:
* store,
* eventbus.

[NOTE]
====
Consumers are defined in the administration area, where the producers are implemented on the system level.
====

== Listing messaging queues

.To list current messaging queues:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. optionally insert the filtering parameters; the list refreshes automatically.

== Creating messaging queues

.To create a new messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the "New" button in the top right corner,
. provide the requested data,
. press the "Submit" button.

"Polling changes delay" affects only the producers that use it (mostly store producers that do not subscribe to changes), so you can usually leave it empty.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* explain ^ a bit better.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
You can only define permissions for existing messaging queues.
====

== Editing messaging queues

.To create a new messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the edit icon next to the messaging queue you wish to edit,
. provide the requested data,
. press the "Submit" button.

== Deleting messaging queues

.To delete an existing messaging queue:
. navigate to the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN},
. click on the "Messaging Queues" in the navigation drawer,
. click on the edit icon next to the messaging queue you wish to edit,
. click and confirm the "Delete" button.

// @todo ?? vv
// === Queue parameters

// *Consumer*
// The consumer parameter defines the destination of the data flow of a particular message queue. Consumers need to be implemented and added as an additional adapter in the code. (see more in #developer section queues consumers)

// *Queue name*
// Should be descriptive, short and alphanumeric only

// *Polling changes delay*
// This is an optional parameter to define the polling time of the producer when it is not feasible to use subscribing to changes.
// Format: golang time.Duration
// Example: _1h90s_, _15s_

// If unsure, leave it empty.
