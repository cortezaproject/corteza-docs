= Generating Code

To generate documentation you need two commands (at some point we'll deprecate the legacy one):

```bash
DOCS_DIR=../path/to/docs/repo make codegen
```

```bash
make codegen-legacy && ~/go/bin/corteza-codegen -d ../path/to/docs/repo
```

[NOTE]
====
The second command is sub optimal, but at this point I'm not entirely sure how to do it in one go (how to pass the `-d` flag to the called command).
