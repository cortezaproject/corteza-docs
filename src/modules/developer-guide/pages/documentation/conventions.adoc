= Conventions

When writing, please use the following conventions as a reference, especially for when you wish to add some extra formatting to your documents.

The bellow list is aggregated from https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc], shortened and adjusted to our needs.

Please, do your best to *follow the conventions* listed below when contributing to the documentation.

We are quite strict in having *1 sentence per line* to have a nicer version history of the document in production.

== Composition, formation, layout

When composing any text it is important to pay attention its formation and layout, especially so when we talk about documents *viewed via electronic devices*.

It is essential to produce a document that is *easy to understand* and *stable* from both the perspective of contents and the visual perspective.
Consistency is crucial.

It may be good to:

.Visually group
* Make sure you group components that fit together, i.e., discussions of the same concept, concept and an example, sub-points and tips...

[NOTE]
====
If something is not relevant in a section, move it elsewhere.
It is better to add a section than to compromise on coherency and fluidity of the document. 
====

.Drawing attention to crucial points
* Use *bold*, *italic*, *links*, *inline code blocks*, and other formatting to point out any crucial points you make.
* *Do not go overboard*, as highlighting excessively results in the decrease of attentiveness to any highlighted sections.

== Lists

You can use lists to provide the document with *additional structure*, to *outline* the essential points, display a *sequence* etc.
Try to keep lists *short*, as they can make the document harder to read.

.Punctuation:
* If a list item is a *proper sentence*, start with a *capital letter*, and end with a *period*.
* If a list item is *not* a *proper sentence*, start with a *lowercase letter*, and (optionally) end with a *comma*.
In case you choose to use commas, start the first item with a capital letter and end the last one with a period. 
* If the entire list is one sentence broken down into clauses for each point, make sure to start the first list item with a capital letter, finish up the point with a comma, continue with a lowercase letter in the following point, finish it up with a comma and so on.
Wrap the list up with a period.
* Do not mix sentence patterns when producing a list.

.Example of a proper sentence; the outline of our documents:
* The *application end-user guide* talks about things relevant to the end-users.
* The *low-code platform developer guide* talks about creating new things based on the {PRODUCT_NAME}.
* The *platform developer guide* helps the core developers keep track on how to maintain different features.

=== Ordered lists

List items in an *ordered list* should *start with a dot* (`. ...content here...`) instead of an actual number (it gets assigned at compile-time).
Please, see the below example.

[source,adoc]
----
.Here we can see:
. list item 1,
. list item 2.
----

Multiple dots should be used when you are indenting the line item.
Please, see the below example.

----
. item (this becomes 1.)
.. sub item (this becomes a.)
... sub sub item (this becomes i.)
----

=== Unordered lists

List items in an *unordered list* should *start with a star* (`* ...content here...`).
Please, see the below example.

[source,adoc]
----
.Here we can see:
* list item 1,
* list item 2.
----

Multiple asterisks (`*` symbol) should be used when indenting the line item.

[TIP]
====
If your list items are long, try to restructure your section, or use multi-line description blocks.
====

=== Multi-line description blocks

Use description blocks when your *lists* start *getting long*.
They firstly present the *key point* of the block, followed by a more *detailed description* that is shifted to the right.

[source,adoc]
----
// Make the key point outline the full description.
// Use four spaces to indent the description.
[Key point here]::
    [Description here].
----

== Corteza documentation structure

DevOps guide::
    The DevOps guide covers all of the DevOps related bits, such as deploying and maintaining.
    ...

Application end-user guide::
    The application end-user guide serves as a reference for end-users that need help with using the Corteza's user interface.
    ...

Low-Code platform developer guide::
    The low-code platform developer guide serves as a reference for integrators -- people that want to build things with Corteza.
    ...

----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Try not to overuse this.
If your descriptions *get long*, it may be better to restructure and divide the text into several sub-sections instead.
====

== Including code snippets

=== Short one-liners

Use *short one-liners* when you wish to show specific *things inline*, such as *CLI commands*, object *properties*, and *variables*.

=== Longer code snippets

When working on examples or longer code snippets, use the source code syntax; `[source,{language here}]`; blocked with four dashes `----`.
Please, see the below example.

```
[source,adoc]
----
// Things go here
----
```

== Admonition

Use the *admonition block* syntax when wanting to create admonitions; where you want *extra attention* to be drawn to.

.You can use the following:
* NOTE
* TIP
* IMPORTANT
* WARNING
* CAUTION

These are pretty much self-explanatory.
Do not overuse.

== Diagrams

*Use the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML]* framework for any diagrams (unless there is an explicit reason for not doing so).
This allows us to *keep things consistent*, *preserve version history* and *easy to maintain*.

[TIP]
====
Move *larger diagrams* into *separate files* to avoid clutter and unreadable source.
====

Provide a good caption to summarize the *entire* diagram. 
You shouldn't use more than one line for a diagram caption.

```
[plantuml,diagram-name-here,svg,role=diagram-name]
----
@startuml

' Diagram definition goes here

@enduml
----
```

[TIP]
====
Larger diagrams may be harder to understand. 
Do your best to *group elements together*, and use a nice *comment* to indicate it.
====

Diagram captions::
    A caption *must be enough* for the reader to get an idea about *what goes on* in a diagram.
    Make sure that the caption gives the reader enough insight to have an idea *what they can expect* to learn *from the diagram*.

Comments::
    A PlantUML comment starts with `'` (single line), or is enclosed between `/'`, and `'/`.
    Please, use the following notation for the sake of consistency;

[source,adoc]
----
' ---------------
' Define comments like so.
' Multiple lines are fine.
' ---------------
----

Diagram structure::
    You are free to use any diagram and any component defined by the diagram.
    *Avoid visual customization* using *Skinparam*.

== Referencing

Use referencing to *link different bits* of information.
We use *two different types* of references:

Page cross-references::
    *Page cross-references* allow us to link *between different documentations*, or even different versions.
    Use the `xref` macro (https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/asciidoc/page-to-page-xref/[The Antora documentation]):

[source,adoc]
----
// Template
xref:guide-goes-here:path-to-source.adoc[label-goes-here]

// For example:
xref:integrator-guide:workflows/index.adoc[Workflows]
----

[TIP]
====
You can also use *anchors* in your `xref`s.
====

Same page references::
    *Same page references* allow us to link in the same documentation section.
    Use the simple page ID reference syntax (https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.2/asciidoc/in-page-xref/[The Antora documentation]):

[source,adoc]
----
// Define a section ID (make sure that it starts with a #)
[#id-goes-here]

// Reference the section ID (there is no # here)
<<id-goes-here>>

// Reference the section ID with a custom label (no space after the comma)
<<id-goes-here,custom-label-goes-here>>
----

=== Important notes

Same page references are simple::
    Same page references can *only link* to things that are *on the current page*.
    In case you try to link to something that is *not on the screen*, the link *will not work*.
    Use *page cross-references*.

Keep section IDs simple::
    Section IDs are relevant *only for the given page*.
    They don't need to be *unique* across the entire documentation, just *for the current page*.
    To exemplify; `[#extension-deployment]`

Don't go overboard::
    If something is *required for the understanding* of the given section, add a *quick summary* and link to the complete document afterwards.
