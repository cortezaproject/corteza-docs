= {PRODUCT_NAME} Core Repositories

== Dependency warnings

Go over each repository and (try to) assure that there aren't any warnings with any of the dependencies.
GitHub provides a friendly system for this, so that shouldn't be an issue.

.Repositories:
. {GIT_MONOREPO_LINK}[`corteza`]: The monorepo containing the codebase for core {PRODUCT_NAME} features.
. {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-server-corredor[`corteza-server-corredor`]: {APP_AUTOMATION} automation runner.
. {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-docs[`corteza-docs`]: {PRODUCT_NAME} documentation.

== Building infrastructure

All {PRODUCT_NAME} repositories utilize GitHub workflows and actions to release server binaries, web application bundles, docker images, or other output formats.

== Versioning

Bump the version of the NPM packages, following the https://calver.org/[CalVer] standard; for example, `2020.9-rc.1`.

Released versions should also be tagged.

.Use this Git command to get it done:
[source,bash]
----
# $V is the version; for example export V=2021.9.0;
git tag $V && git push origin $V;
----

== NPM packages

[CAUTION]
====
The rest of the repositories depend on these two, so you should handle them first.

* commit the changes
* tag the version
* run `yarn build` to build the package
* run `npm publish --dry-run` to test the publish
* run `npm publish` to publish
* push the changes and the created tag to the Github repository

== Web applications and Corredor server

.Steps to release:
* bump the version
* run `yarn cdeps` to update all required {PRODUCT_NAME} dependencies
* commit the changes
* tag the version
* push the changes and the created tag to the Github repository

.The steps defined above should be used for all core repositories:
. {GIT_MONOREPO_LINK}[`corteza`]: The monorepo containing the codebase for core {PRODUCT_NAME} features.
. {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-server-corredor[`corteza-server-corredor`]: {APP_AUTOMATION} automation runner.

== Server

.Steps to release:
* commit the changes
* tag the version
* push the changes and the created tag to the Github repository

== Binaries & Bundles

All of the outputs are stored on the https://releases.{DOMAIN}/files.
When building the Docker images, the sources are taken from the storage mentioned above.

The Docker images are placed on the https://hub.docker.com/u/cortezaproject[DockerHub].

Unofficially, you can use the released packages with a Vagrant box {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-vagrant.

Alternatively, you can (build and) install these packages manually, either on the virtual machine or a regular machine.
