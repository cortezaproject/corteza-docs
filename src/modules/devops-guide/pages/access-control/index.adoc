* Bypass: `RBAC_BYPASS_ROLES`; defaults to `super-admin`.
Bypass roles may *not* appear in any of the other lists.
* Authenticated: `RBAC_AUTHENTICATED_ROLES`; defaults to `authenticated`.
Authenticated roles may *not* appear in any of the other lists.
* Anonymous: `RBAC_ANONYMOUS_ROLES`; defaults to `anonymous`.

The `.env` variables accept a space-delimited list of role handles.
