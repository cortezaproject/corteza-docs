= Importing Resource Translations
:page-aliases: 2023.3@cli/resource-translation-import.adoc

[IMPORTANT]
====
After you have imported the translations, you need to restart the server for the changes to take affect.
Translations are kept in-memory of the process running the server.
We are looking into improving this in the future releases.
====

[CAUTION]
====
Before importing larger datasets (especially to production), it is advised to make a database backup and to test the configuration locally or on a staging server.
====

.To import resource translations you need to:
. Prepare the source files,
. run the command.

== Source Files

Prepare a directory where all of your source files reside in.

.`/import`:
[source]
----
/import
  /corteza::compose:module.yaml
  /corteza::compose:namespace.yaml
  /resource-translation.yaml
----

The `resource-translation.yaml` file contains the resource translations you wish to import, and the other two files,(`corteza::compose:module.yaml` and `corteza::compose:namespace.yaml`) contain the definitions for the resources we are applying the translations for.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The current resource-translations importer requires you to provide the definitions for the resources you are applying the translations for.
We are looking in improving this in the future releases
====

== Running the Import

Use the xref:references/cli-reference.adoc#import[import CLI command] to import your resource-translations.

The argument to the CLI command needs to be the location of the source files, in our above case this is `/import`.

[NOTE]
====
By default, the import CLI command skips already existing resources.

.You can control the behavior using the following flags:
[source]
----
--merge-left-existing             Update any existing values; existing data takes priority. Default skips.
--merge-right-existing            Update any existing values; new data takes priority. Default skips.
--replace-existing                Replace any existing values. Default skips.
----

====

.An example of running the CLI command for our case:
[source,bash]
----
corteza-server import /import
----
