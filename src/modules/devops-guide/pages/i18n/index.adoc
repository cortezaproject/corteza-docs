{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to fully translate most aspect of the system.
From the <<ui-translations,user interface>> to custom <<resource-translations,{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configurations>> such as modules and their fields.

User interface translations are provided via static `.yaml` files, which are bundled into the `corteza-server` docker image.

If you wish to upload additional or modified translations, you need to do some server-side configuration.

== Configuring the System

Applying the following steps allows your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance to serve customized translations.

[CAUTION]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} ignores translations for languages that are not defined in the `.env` file.
See <<languages-manage,managing languages>> for details.
====

=== Preparing the File Structure

Create a new directory on the server running {PRODUCT_NAME}.

.Lets assume the file structure looks like this:
[source]
----
üìÅ my-corteza
  üìÑ docker-compose.yaml
  üìÑ .env
  üìÅ my-locale <1>
    üìÅ src <2>
----
<1> We use the `my-locale` directory to hold our custom translations and any corresponding metadata.
<2> The `src` directory holds the translation files and appropriate configuration files.

=== System Configurations

Firstly, define the volume in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
An example following the above file system would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.5'

services:
// ...
// Additional services here
// ...

  server:
    image: cortezaproject/corteza:${VERSION}
    restart: always
    env_file: [ .env ]
    depends_on: [ db ]
    volumes: ["./my-locale:/my-locale"] <1>
    // ...
    // Additional configurations here
    // ...

// ...
// Additional services here
// ...
----
<1> This is where you mount the volume.

Secondly, you need to tell {PRODUCT_NAME} where the translations are located at.
This is done by the `LOCALE_PATH` `.env` variable.
An example following the above setup would look like this:

[source,env]
----
// ...
// Additional configurations here
// ...

LOCALE_PATH=../my-locale/src <1>

// ...
// Additional configurations here
// ...
----
<1> This is where you define the path.
If you wish to define multiple paths, use the colon (`:`) as the delimiter.
To exemplify; `LOCALE_PATH="../my-locale-en/src:../my-locale-de/src"`.
When multiple paths are used, defiitions are overriden in the same order as defined.

=== Applying Changes

After all of the configuration is in place, you need to reload the configurations.

.Run:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you update translation files after {PRODUCT_NAME} server started, you must restart it.

.Run:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose restart
----
====

[#languages-manage]
== Managing Available Languages

The languages that you wish to support by your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance *must* be defined by the `LOCALE_LANGUAGES` `.env` variable.

The language tag must follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag[BCP-47] standard.
An extensive list of languages is available https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php[here].

Languages can be defined using a simple language tag, such as `en` and `sl`.
If you need to be more specific, you can use a region suffix, such as `en-US` and `en-UK`.
{PRODUCT_NAME} tries to detect the language from the request headers and serve appropriate translation.

If you want to define multiple languages, you need to separate them with a comma (`,`).

.An example configuration that uses English, German, and Italian languages:
[source]
----
LOCALE_LANGUAGES="en,de,it"
----

== Development Environment

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides some helpful utilities for debugging and general translations, which can be enabled with the following `.env` variables.

[cols="2s,5a"]
|===
| Variable | Description

| [#env-locale_log]#<<env-locale_log,`LOCALE_LOG`>>#
| The `LOCALE_LOG` variable makes the {PRODUCT_NAME} server output logs of what is happening in the system.
This can help you debug issues.

| [#env-locale_development_mode]#<<env-locale_development_mode,`LOCALE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`>>#
| The `LOCALE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` variable makes translation modifications easier, as the translation files are loaded for each request instead of at boot-time.

|===

== Troubleshooting

=== Language Not Loaded as Expected?

When languages do not load as expected, enable logging and restart the server.
First few log lines should describe what is going on and what languages are loaded.
