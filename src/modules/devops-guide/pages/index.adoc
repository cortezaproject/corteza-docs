:description: Learn how to setup and maintain {PRODUCT_NAME}
:keywords: Dev-Pps, DevOps, setup, configure, deploy, maintenance

The DevOps guide covers the process of setting up, configuring, and maintaining your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance.

This page attempts to provide simple instructions to setup an instance that should be used for most cases.
More complex use cases and advanced readers should refer to additional DevOps guide sub pages.

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} is compiled, developed, and tested for modern browsers.
If you need to support older browsers, such as InternetExplorer, you will need to build your images.
Refer to xref:system-requirements.adoc[] for more details.
====

== Prerequisites

[#docker]
=== Docker

To use our pre-built Docker images, you will need to have Docker setup and running on every system you wish to set up {PRODUCT_NAME}.
You can follow https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[the official documentation] to get it setup.

Alternatively, you can download prebuilt sources from our https://releases.cortezaproject.org/files/[releases page] or you can build your own.

[#docker-compose]
=== Docker Compose

Docker Compose makes your life easier when running multiple Docker images where each can be arbitrarily configured.
You can follow https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/[the official documentation] to get it setup.

[NOTE]
====
When using `.env` files, you need to explicitly specify this inside the `docker-compose.yaml` file, for example:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.5'

services:
  server:
    image: cortezaproject/corteza:${VERSION}
    restart: always
    env_file: [ .env ] # <- see here
    depends_on: [ db ]
    ports: [ "127.0.0.1:18084:80" ]

  # ...

The web applications communicate with the server over the REST API and authenticate via the authentication server.

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_DISCOVERY} additionally communicates with `corteza-server-discovery`.

The server interacts with all internal auxiliary services such as the database, object storage, error and log tracking, automation runners, ...

.Some of the auxiliary services include:
* data federation,
* data storage,
* logger,
* email sender.

=== {PRODUCT_NAME} repositories and their relation

.The diagram outlines {PRODUCT_NAME} repositories and their relation in regards to the build pipeline.
image::developer-guide:build-pipelines.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.{PRODUCT_NAME} defines a series of web applications defined by our `corteza-webapp-*` repositories:
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-compose[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-workflow[*{PRODUCT_NAME} Workflow*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-admin[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-reporter[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_REPORTER}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-discovery[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_DISCOVERY}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-one[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_SHELL}*]

== System configuration files

{PRODUCT_NAME} is configured via the environment (`.env`) file.
It allows you to quickly deploy and configure how {PRODUCT_NAME} should behave on another system.

Our examples are configured to work as is, but feel free to tweak the xref:references/configuration/server.adoc[server] and the xref:references/configuration/corredor.adoc[{APP_AUTOMATION} server] as you see fit.

[NOTE]
====
The `.env` file is at the root of the project folder.
In the context of Docker Compose, it is next to the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
====

The `.env` file performs *implicit Docker Compose configuration*, *variable substitution for Docker configurations*, and *service configurations*.

You can use variables defined in the `.env` file inside your `docker-compose.yaml` files using `$\{VARIABLE_HERE}`.

[#deploy-offline]
== Deploy offline

Offline deployments run all services on the same network where the ports are bound to the host's network.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Offline deployments are suitable only for local development and demos (environments that are not accessible from the outside).
====

This section provides a minimum setup with PostgreSQL as the persistent database storage.
See xref:examples/deploy-offline/index.adoc[] for example offline deployment configurations.

=== Setup your file structure

.Your file structure should look like this:
[source]
----
📁 my-corteza
  📄 .env
  📄 docker-compose.yaml
  📁 data <1>
    📁 server <2>
    📁 db <3>
----
<1> Make sure to change the owner to the Docker container (you can use `chown 1001:1001 data/db` and `chown 4242:4242 data/server`).
Omit if you won't use persistent storage.
<2> Here is where all of the server data is stored, such as uploaded attachments.
<3> Here is where the database data is stored.

=== Configure docker-compose.yaml

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

=== Configure .env

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,.env]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/env-example.txt[]
----

=== Run the services

In the root of your project (next to your `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` files), run the docker compose (the execution can take a few seconds).
The command (downloads and) runs all of the services configured in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/output-ps.txt[]
----

See xref:troubleshooting/index.adoc[] if something went wrong/failed to start.

=== Test the deploy

. Direct your browser to http://localhost:18080 (change the port if you used a different port).
You will be redirected to the authentication page (`/auth`).
. Create your account through the sign-up form (the first created account is an administrator by default).
. Check the server version http://localhost:18080/version
. Check the server's health http://localhost:18080/healthcheck
. Check the API documentation http://localhost:18080/api/docs/

[NOTE]
====
If you did not configure your SMTP settings, all sign-ups are marked as confirmed.
====

[#deploy-online]
== Deploy online

[NOTE]
====
If you're using Nginx and the WebSocket connection is failing, refer to xref:troubleshooting/index.adoc#ws-nginx-connection-fail[menu:Maintenance[Troubleshooting]].
====

Online setups separate your services into two networks; internal and proxy.
The internal network hides most of the system from the internet.
This section provides a minimum setup with MySQL as the persistent database storage with {APP_AUTOMATION} server enabled.

[TIP]
====
You can use the same steps to configure multiple online deployments, such as a staging and a production environment.
====

See xref:examples/deploy-online/index.adoc[] for example online deployment configurations.

=== Setup your file structure

.Your file structure should look like this:
[source]
----
📁 my-proxy <1>
  📄 docker-compose.yaml
  📄 custom.conf <2>
📁 my-corteza
  📄 .env
  📄 docker-compose.yaml
  📁 data <3>
    📁 server <4>
    📁 db <5>
----
<1> Omit this if you're not planning on using Nginx reverse proxy or if it's already setup.
<2> `custom.conf` must be placed next to the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
<3> Make sure to change the owner to the Docker container (you can use `chown 1001:1001 data/db` and `chown 4242:4242 data/server`).
Omit if you won't use persistent storage.
<4> Here is where all of the server stuff is stored, such as uploaded attachments.
<5> Here is where the database can store the data.

=== Setup your Nginx reverse proxy

⚠️ We are inside the `my-proxy` directory.

This part automates the creation and renewal of Let's Encrypt TLS certificates, forward traffic to Docker containers, and simplifies complicated firewall configurations.

[CAUTION]
====
The following instructions assume that you don't have anything similar setup in your current environment.

If you are using other means of providing traffic forwarding or SSL certificate handling, proceed with caution.
====

We will be using https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy[Nginx Proxy] and https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion[LetsEncrypt Nginx Proxy Companion].
If you wish to use or are using something else, feel free to skip this section.


.Your `docker-compose.yaml` should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

.Your `custom.conf` should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/custom.conf[]
----

Inside your `my-proxy` directory, run `docker-compose up -d` (the execution can take a few seconds) to start the reverse proxy.

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/output-ps.txt[]
----

=== Configure docker-compose.yaml

⚠️ We are inside the `my-corteza` directory.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Containers *must* be on the same network as `nginx-proxy` (in the examples, we're using a network named `proxy`).
====

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

=== Configure .env

⚠️ We are inside the `my-corteza` directory.

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,.env]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/env-example.txt[]
----

=== Run the services

Inside your `my-corteza` directory (next to your `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` files), run the docker compose (the execution can take a few seconds).
The command (downloads and) runs all of the services configured in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/output-ps.txt[]
----

See xref:troubleshooting/index.adoc[] if something went wrong/failed to start.

=== Test the deploy

. Direct your browser to `http://your-demo.example.tld`.
You will be redirected to the authentication page (`/auth`).
. Create your account through the sign-up form (the first created account is an administrator by default).
. Check the server version http://your-demo.example.tld/version
. Check the server's health http://your-demo.example.tld/healthcheck
. Check the API documentation http://your-demo.example.tld/api/docs/
