:description: {PRODUCT_NAME} DevOpsGuide covers all aspects of deploying and maintaining your own {PRODUCT_NAME} instance.
:keywords: dev-ops, devops, {PRODUCT_NAME}

The *DevOps guide* is designed to help you *deploy and maintain* your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance.
The guide provides enough out of the box working examples to get you up and running.

[NOTE]
====
This page provides all of the information to run your {PRODUCT_NAME} using our prebuilt docker images.
If you need additional information regarding specific topics, refer to the menu:DevOps guide[] sub-sections.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} is compiled, developed, and tested for modern browsers.
If you need to support older browsers, such as InternetExplorer, you will need to build your images.
Refer to xref:system-requirements.adoc[] for more details.

== Architecture and repository overview

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* update diagram; rewrite to PlantUML.

// .The diagram visually describes where various components reside and how they interact.
// image::arch-overview.png[{PRODUCT_NAME} architectural overview]
====

.{PRODUCT_NAME} defines a series of web applications defined by our `corteza-webapp-*` repositories:
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-compose[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-workflow[*{PRODUCT_NAME} Workflow*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-admin[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}*]
* {GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-webapp-one[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_SHELL}*]

The web applications communicate with our back-end system ({GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-server[*{PRODUCT_NAME} server*]) which further interacts with the automation script runner ({GIT_REPO_LINK_PREFIX}-server-corredor[*{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_AUTOMATION} server*]) and various auxiliary services primarily provided by external services/projects.

.Some of the auxiliary services include:
* data federation,
* data storage,
* logger,
* email sender.

== System configuration

{PRODUCT_NAME} is configured via the environment (`.env`) file.
It allows you to quickly deploy and configure how {PRODUCT_NAME} should behave on another system.

Our examples are configured to work as is, but feel free to tweak the xref:configuration/server.adoc[server] and the xref:configuration/corredor.adoc[{APP_AUTOMATION} server] as you see fit.

[NOTE]
====
The `.env` file is at the root of the project folder.
In the context of Docker Compose, it is next to the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
====

The `.env` file performs *implicit Docker Compose configuration*, *variable substitution for Docker configurations*, and *service configurations*.

You can use variables defined in the `.env` file inside your `docker-compose.yaml` files using `$\{VARIABLE_HERE}`.

[#deploy-offline]
== Deploy offline

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* provide a quick rundown of what each deploy config enables you to do; automation scripts, workflows, persistent storage, ...
====

Offline setups run all services on the same network where the ports are bound to the host's network.
This section provides a minimum setup with MySQL as the persistent database storage with {APP_AUTOMATION} server enabled.

See menu:DevOps guide[Offline deployment] for additional offline deployment configurations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Offline deployments are suitable only for local development and demos (environments that are not accessible from the outside).
====

=== Setup your file structure

.Your file structure should look like this:
[source]
----
üìÅ my-corteza
  üìÑ .env
  üìÑ docker-compose.yaml
  üìÅ data <1>
    üìÅ server <2>
    üìÅ db <3>
----
<1> Make sure to change the owner to the Docker container (you can use `chown 1001:1001 data/db` and `chown 4242:4242 data/server`).
Omit if you won't use persistent storage.
<2> Here is where all of the server data is stored, such as uploaded attachments.
<3> Here is where the database data is stored.

=== Configure docker-compose.yaml

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

=== Configure .env

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,.env]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/env-example.txt[]
----

=== Run the services

In the root of your project (next to your `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` files), run the docker compose (the execution can take a few seconds).
The command (downloads and) runs all of the services configured in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/local-mysql/output-ps.txt[]
----

See xref:maintenance/troubleshooting.adoc[] if something went wrong/failed to start.

=== Test the deploy

. Direct your browser to http://localhost:18080 (change the port if you used a different port).
You will be redirected to the authentication page (`/auth`).
. Create your account through the sign-up form (the first created account is an administrator by default).
. Check the server version http://localhost:18080/version
. Check the server's health http://localhost:18080/healthcheck
. Check the API documentation http://localhost:18080/api/docs/

[NOTE]
====
If you did not configure your SMTP settings, all sign-ups are marked as confirmed.
====

[#deploy-online]
== Deploy online

Online setups separate your services into two networks; internal and proxy.
The internal network hides most of the system from the internet.
This section provides a minimum setup with MySQL as the persistent database storage with {APP_AUTOMATION} server enabled.

See menu:DevOps guide[Online deployment] for additional online deployment configurations.

[TIP]
====
You can use the same steps to configure multiple online deployments, such as a staging and a production environment.
====

=== Setup your file structure

.Your file structure should look like this:
[source]
----
üìÅ my-proxy <1>
  üìÑ docker-compose.yaml
  üìÑ custom.conf <2>
üìÅ my-corteza
  üìÑ .env
  üìÑ docker-compose.yaml
  üìÅ data <3>
    üìÅ server <4>
    üìÅ db <5>
----
<1> Omit this if you're not planning on using Nginx reverse proxy or if it's already setup.
<2> `custom.conf` must be placed next to the `docker-compose.yaml` file.
<3> Make sure to change the owner to the Docker container (you can use `chown 1001:1001 data/db` and `chown 4242:4242 data/server`).
Omit if you won't use persistent storage.
<4> Here is where all of the server stuff is stored, such as uploaded attachments.
<5> Here is where the database can store the data.

=== Setup your Nginx reverse proxy

‚ö†Ô∏è We are inside the `my-proxy` directory.

This part automates the creation and renewal of Let's Encrypt TLS certificates, forward traffic to Docker containers, and simplifies complicated firewall configurations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The following instructions assume that you don't have anything similar setup in your current environment.

If you are using other means of providing traffic forwarding or SSL certificate handling, proceed with caution.
====

We will be using https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy[Nginx Proxy] and https://github.com/JrCs/docker-letsencrypt-nginx-proxy-companion[LetsEncrypt Nginx Proxy Companion].
If you wish to use or are using something else, feel free to skip this section.


.Your `docker-compose.yaml` should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

.Your `custom.conf` should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/custom.conf[]
----

Inside your `my-proxy` directory, run `docker-compose up -d` (the execution can take a few seconds) to start the reverse proxy.

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-proxy-nginx/output-ps.txt[]
----

=== Setup websocket proxying

This part define https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616#section-13.5.1[hop-by-hop] headers to be passed from a client to proxied server.
This will allow websockets proxying to works with your nginx configuration above.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The complete guide is available on https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html[nginx documentation website] and provide much more information and examples.
====

Inside your `nginx.conf` file (default placed under `/etc/nginx` directory) add these following lines inside your "server" configuration section.

[source]
----
location /api/websocket {
  proxy_pass http://server:80;
  proxy_http_version 1.1;
  proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
  proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
  proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
----

=== Configure docker-compose.yaml

‚ö†Ô∏è We are inside the `my-corteza` directory.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Containers *must* be on the same network as `nginx-proxy` (in the examples, we're using a network named `proxy`).
====

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,yaml]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/docker-compose.yaml[]
----

=== Configure .env

‚ö†Ô∏è We are inside the `my-corteza` directory.

.Your configuration should look like this:
[source,.env]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/env-example.txt[]
----

=== Run the services

Inside your `my-corteza` directory (next to your `docker-compose.yaml` and `.env` files), run the docker compose (the execution can take a few seconds).
The command (downloads and) runs all of the services configured in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.

[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

Check if everything started correctly by running `docker-compose ps`.
The output should look like this:

[source]
----
include::example$deploy/prod-mysql/output-ps.txt[]
----

See xref:maintenance/troubleshooting.adoc[] if something went wrong/failed to start.

=== Test the deploy

. Direct your browser to `http://your-demo.example.tld`.
You will be redirected to the authentication page (`/auth`).
. Create your account through the sign-up form (the first created account is an administrator by default).
. Check the server version http://your-demo.example.tld/version
. Check the server's health http://your-demo.example.tld/healthcheck
. Check the API documentation http://your-demo.example.tld/api/docs/
