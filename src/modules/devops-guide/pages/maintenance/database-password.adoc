== Database

=== MySQL

You should be able to do that by logging into the container with

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
----

Once you are inside container you can use mysql cli to change the password

[source,bash]
----
mysql -u<root_mysql_user> -p<old_password>
----

For MySQL 5.7 and above you should run

[source,bash]
----
mysql> SET PASSWORD FOR 'root' = PASSWORD('new_password');
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----

For older versions you should run

[source,bash]
----
mysql> ALTER USER '<mysql_user>'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<mysql_password>';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
----


=== PostgreSQL

You should be able to do that by logging into the container with

[source,bash]
----
docker exec -it <container_id> bash
----

Once you are inside container you can use psql cli to change the password

[source,bash]
----
psql --user <postgresql_user>
\password
