= Internationalisation

{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to fully translate most aspect of the system.
From the <<ui-translations,user interface>> to custom <<resource-translations,{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configurations>> such as modules and their fields.

User interface translations are provided via static `.yaml` files which are bundled into the `corteza-server` docker image.

If you wish to upload additional or modified translations, you will need to do some server-side configuration.

== Configuring the system

Applying the following steps will allow your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance to serve customized translations.

[CAUTION]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} will ignore translations for languages that are not defined in the `.env` file.
See <<languages-manage,managing languages>> for details.
====

=== Prepare the file structure

Create a new directory on the server running {PRODUCT_NAME}.

.Lets assume the file structure looks like this:
[source]
----
üìÅ my-corteza
  üìÑ docker-compose.yaml
  üìÑ .env
  üìÅ my-locale <1>
    üìÅ src <2>
----
<1> We will use the `my-locale` directory to hold our custom translations and any corresponding metadata.
<2> The `src` directory will hold the translation files and appropriate configuration files.

=== System configurations

Firstly define the volume in your `docker-compose.yaml` file.
An example following the above file system would look like this:

[source,yaml]
----
version: '3.5'

services:
// ...
// Additional services here
// ...

  server:
    image: cortezaproject/corteza-server:${VERSION}
    restart: on-failure
    env_file: [ .env ]
    depends_on: [ db ]
    volumes: ["./my-locale:/my-locale"] <1>
    // ...
    // Additional configurations here
    // ...

// ...
// Additional services here
// ...
----
<1> This is where you mount the volume.

Secondly, you need to tell {PRODUCT_NAME} where the translations are located at.
This is done by the `LOCALE_PATH` `.env` variable.
An example following the above setup would look like this:

[source,env]
----
// ...
// Additional configurations here
// ...

LOCALE_PATH=../my-locale/src <1>

// ...
// Additional configurations here
// ...
----
<1> This is where you define the path.
If you wish to define multiple paths, use the comma (`,`) as the delimiter.
To examplify; `LOCALE_PATH="../my-locale-en/src,../my-locale-de/src"`

=== Applying changes

After all of the configuration is in place you will need to reload the configurations.

.Run:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you upload updated translations after the initial setup, you will need to restart the {PRODUCT_NAME} server.

.Run:
[source,bash]
----
docker-compose restart
----
====

[#languages-manage]
== Managing available languages

The languages that you wish to support by your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance *must* be defined by the `LOCALE_LANGUAGES` `.env` variable.

The language tag must follow the BCP-47 standard.
An extensive list of languages is available https://www.techonthenet.com/js/language_tags.php[here]

If you want to define multiple languages, you need to separate them with a comma (`,`).

.An example config that uses English, German, and Italian languages:
[source]
----
LOCALE_LANGUAGES="en,de,it"
----

== Development environment

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides some helpful utilities for debugging and general translations that can be enabled with the following `.env` variables.

[cols="2s,5a"]
|===
| Variable | Description

| [#env-locale_log]#<<env-locale_log,`LOCALE_LOG`>>#
| The `LOCALE_LOG` variable makes the {PRODUCT_NAME} server output logs of what is happening in the system.
This can help you debug issues.

| [#env-locale_development_mode]#<<env-locale_development_mode,`LOCALE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`>>#
| The `LOCALE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` variable makes translation modifications easier, as the translation files are loaded for each request instead of at boot-time.
