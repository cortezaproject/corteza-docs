{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to detect incoming HTTP requests via automation scripts -- sink routes.
Sink routes allow you to implement custom API endpoints to add support for things like webhooks.

[NOTE]
====
Here, we only cover how to setup a sink route.
Refer to the xref:integrator-guide:index.adoc[] for details on how to use them.
====

== Generating a Signature

A *sink signature* is used to authorize incoming HTTP requests to the `/sink` route.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Sink signatures should be treated as passwords.
====

A sink signature is generated using the xref:references/cli-reference.adoc#sink-signature[sink signature] CLI command.

For example `{CLI_CMD} sink signature` returns such an output (the signature will be different):

[source]
----
/system/sink?__sign=187...3D
Sink request constraints:
 - signature should be part of query-string
 - body size is not limited
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Refer to the CLI command reference for details on available options (`{CLI_CMD} sink signature -h`).
The above command creates an unconstrained signature (any request is considered as valid).
====

The signature can be found at the end of the `__sign` query parameter.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This signature should be stored somewhere safe as it is required to authenticate any request to the sink route.
====

Each request to the sink route must specify the sink signature we generated above.

[CAUTION]
====
Some services (when implementing the OAuth2 flow) may not allow the use of query parameters.
See <<sign-in-path>> to bypass the restriction.
====

== Use the Sink Route

When you need to use the sink route (e.g. you wish to define a webhook), all inbound requests must specify the sink signature generated above.
Either in the query parameter or in the path (depending on the provided CLI parameters).

For example:
[source,bash]
----
curl '$BASE_API_URL/system/sink?__sign=$SINK_SIGNATURE' \
  --data-binary '{
    "a": "b"
  }';
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
Note that when using a custom API base URL (see: xref:configuration/server.adoc#_http_api_base_url[HTTP_API_BASE_URL]) or you have webapp incorporated into the server (see: xref:configuration/server.adoc#_http_webapp_enabled[HTTP_WEBAPP_ENABLED]), the sink url would be prefixed (ie by default per webapp enabled: `$BASE_API_URL/api/system/sink?__sign=$SINK_SIGNATURE`).
====

[#sign-in-path]
== Unable to Use Query Parameters?

If you can't use a query parameter to authenticate the request, add the `--signature-in-path` argument tho the xref:references/cli-reference.adoc#sink-signature[sink signature] CLI command.

For example `{CLI_CMD} sink signature --signature-in-path` returns such an output (the signature will be different):

[source]
----
/system/sink/ext_mautic/lead/__sign=7a9...==
Sink request constraints:
 - signature should be part of path
 - body size is not limited
----

[CAUTION]
====
The "in path" signature *can not be used* inside a query parameter and vice-versa.
