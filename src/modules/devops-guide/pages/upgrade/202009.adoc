.Follow this set of steps to properly update your instance:
. Rename the Service Cloud namespace name to {PRODUCT_NAME} Case Management
. Change the service-cloud namespace slug to case-management
. Go over each page in the {PRODUCT_NAME} Case Management namespace and replace the old service-cloud automation buttons with new case-management buttons
. Test your changes to assure everything works as expected
