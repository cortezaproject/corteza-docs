== After the Upgrade

=== Field Expressions and Automation Scripts

With the introduction of field expressions, some {APP_AUTOMATION} automation scripts became obsolete and were removed from the 2020.12 release.
This affects existing deployments that use CRM and Case Management applications.

THe automated upgrade does not replace the removed automation scripts with module field expressions in case you've manually changed parts of the configuration.
The removed automation scripts need to be manually replaced with module field expressions.

=== Federation (experimental feature)

Currently {PRODUCT_NAME} does not import Federation roles and RBAC rules when upgrading existing database.
This can be done manually by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
docker-compose exec server corteza-server import /corteza/provision/200_federation
----
