== Docker Image Changes

{PRODUCT_NAME} changed how Docker images are structured from 2021.9 on.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you were using `cortezaproject/corteza-server` to run server and web applications before `2021.9`, you must switch to `cortezaproject/corteza`.
====

Docker image `cortezaproject/corteza-server` in `2021.9` should be used only as application server.
