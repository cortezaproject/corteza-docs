== After the Upgrade

{PRODUCT_NAME} `2023.3` introduces a new resource - `corteza:compose:page-layout`.
As with most other resources, it introduces new RBAC rules.

Re-visit your security model setup and adjust your RBAC rules to incorporate the new resource.

[CAUTION]
====
If a specific role does not have read access to a specific page layout, that layout will not be shown and some pages may appear empty (due to no page layouts being available).
