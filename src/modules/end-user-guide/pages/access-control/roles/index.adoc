= Role Management

== What are roles ?

Rather than assigning individual permissions directly to each user, permissions are grouped into roles. You can define one or more roles on your site, and then grant permissions to each role. 

The permissions granted to authenticated and anonymous users are contained in the Authenticated user and Anonymous user roles, and depending on the installation profile you used when you installed your site, there may also be an Administrator role that is automatically assigned all permissions on your site.

Each user account on your site is automatically given the Authenticated user role, and may optionally be assigned one or more additional roles. When you assign a role to a user account, the user will have all the permissions of the role when logged in.

It is good practice to make several roles in your corteza instance. You might want the following roles on your corteza instance

* Adminstartor 

* Security adminstrator

* Low code adminstrator
