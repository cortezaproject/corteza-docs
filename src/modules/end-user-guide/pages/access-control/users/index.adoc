= User

A user, or user account, allows an employee to establish a presence on the network in order to gain access to important files and folders. Without a user account, which typically requires a user name and password, an employee credentials cannot be authenticated and he or she is unknown to the network.

A user account inside an organization is what identifies an individual as authorized to enter the network and prevents the outside world from getting into a business' system. Most users have a standard account, with permissions set by another type of user account - an administrator.

User accounts are designed to enable an administrator to assign file access and grant task permissions.

A group is made up of users that needs the same access rights to the same resources, folders and files.
