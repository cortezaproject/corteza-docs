The Cases page is accessible by clicking on the menu:Mode[Cases] section in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

The {PRODUCT_NAME} CRM implements a simplified case management tool.
It allows you to keep track of various customer complaints, disputes or similar.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The CRM and the xref:service-solution/index.adoc[Service Solution] do not share data.
====

Cases can be linked to accounts, contacts, products or even to other cases.

You can define who is part of the case, what role they have, keep track of the progress, assign tasks and add notes.

[NOTE]
====
You can store a resolved case as a "Solution".
Solutions help you to solve similar (future) cases with ease.
