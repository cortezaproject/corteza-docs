The Events page is accessible by clicking on the "Events" under the "More" dropdown in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

Events help you stay organized by keeping track of the things you should do.

You can access your events either from the Events page or from the homepage.
They are also accessible from any other page that allows events; such as leads and opportunities.
