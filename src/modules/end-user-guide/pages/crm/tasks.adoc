= Tasks

The Tasks page is accessible by clicking on the menu:Tasks[] in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

Tasks allow you to keep track of outstanding tasks that need to be handled and are displayed in the list or on the calendar on the homepage.
Tasks can refer to leads, accounts, contacts, opportunities, quotes, or contracts.
//Nika's note: outstanding seems inappropriate, try tasks that are out of the ordinary (if that is the meaning), substitute the word for sth else or leave the premodification out entirely

[NOTE]
====
Make sure to mark the task as "closed" once it has been completed.
