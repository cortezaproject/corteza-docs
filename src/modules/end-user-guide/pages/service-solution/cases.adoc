= Cases

The Cases page is accessible by clicking on the menu:Cases[] in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

.There are three pages dedicated to cases:
* menu:Cases[] shows all of the cases in the system,
* menu:All New cases[] shows only the cases that have the `status of being new,
* menu:My new cases[] shows only the new cases that you are responsible for.

.A typical case flow:
. A client contacts the company with an issue,
. the service agent checks the clients account to see if their entitlements permit support for the issue,
. if the client is entitled to support, a new case is created, directly from the account page,
. the agent inserts any relevant parameters to the case, assigns a category (the default is "problem"), links any related products, contacts, and assigns an agent,
. the assigned agent works on the case, creates updates and finally closes the case.

. click on the btn:[+ Add] button to open the form,
. populate the data and press the btn:[Save] button in the bottom right corner.
