The home page is accessible by clicking on the "Home" in the main navigation bar on the top of the screen.

The homepage is sort of like a dashboard for your business -- it gives a quick overview of your cases, so you know what is going on.

It shows you essential statistics regarding your cases, such as cases by priority, status, and category.
