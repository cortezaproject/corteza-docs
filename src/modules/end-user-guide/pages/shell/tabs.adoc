= Tabs

Tabs allow you to show one or more applications inside any given panel -- they work just like browser tabs.

To open a new tab, click on the plus icon (`+`) on the top of the panel.
This opens the application selector menu where you can choose what application you wish to open.
Click on the application to open it.

When you hove over an application, you will notice an arrow icon.
Clicking on it will open the application in a new browser tab instead of the panel.

[NOTE]
====
Depending on how your system is set up, you might already see some applications opened out of the box.
