{PRODUCT_NAME} implements an SQL-like syntax for querying and sorting records.

== Querying

.The general template for constructing a query looks like this:
[source]
----
FIELD OPERATOR VALUE [AND|OR FIELD OPERATOR VALUE [...]]
----

****
* `[ ]` indicates that the encapsulated contents are optional.
* `...` means that the current encapsulated content is repeated.
****

For the following examples, let us assume that we have a module named `test` with the following fields:

* `quantity` of type `Number`
* `price` of type `Number`
* `name` of type `String`
* `visible` of type `Checkbox`

.To query for records with zero quantity or zero price:
[source]
----
quantity = 0 or price = zero
----

.To query all visible records starting with the letter "a":
[source]
----
visible AND name LIKE 'a%'
----

=== Comparison operators

Equal::
  * `=`
Not equal::
  * `!=`
  * `<>`
Less then::
  * `<`
Less or equal then::
 * `\<=`
Greater then::
  * `>`
Greater or equal then::
  * `>=`
Matches pattern::
  * `LIKE`
Does not match the pattern::
  * `NOT LIKE`

When matching patterns, use `_` to represent a single character; use `%` to represent zero, one, or multiple characters.

=== Arithmetic operators

Addition::
  * `+`
Subtraction::
  * `-`
Multiplication::
  * `*`
Division::
  * `/`

=== Boolean operators

* `AND`: truthy when left and right are truthy
* `OR`: truthy when left or right is truthy

[#query-mv]
=== Multi-value fields

Filters for multi-value fields look precisely the same as they would for regular fields.

.To exemplify; let us consider a module with the following fields:
* Field name: `users`, field type: `user selector`, multi value option checked.
* Field name: `selects`, field type: `Select / dropdown`, multi value option checked.

.The following table provides a series of examples with the corresponding query and the expected output:
[cols="2s,5m,5a"]
|===
| [#query-mv-example-1]#<<query-mv-example-2,Filter for current user>>#
| users = $\{userID}
| The filter returns the records where either one of the multi-value values matches the current user.

| [#query-mv-example-3]#<<query-mv-example-4,Filter select for pattern>>#
| selects LIKE 'a%'
| The filter returns the records where either one of the multi-value select options matches the `a%` pattern.

| [#query-mv-example-5]#<<query-mv-example-6,Filter select for value>>#
| selects = 'a2'
| The filter returns the records where either one of the multi-value select options equals `a2`.

|===

== Sorting

.The general template for constructing a sort looks like this:
[source]
----
FIELD[ DIRECTION][, FIELD[ DIRECTION] [...]]
----

****
* `[ ]` indicates that the encapsulated contents are optional.
* `...` means that the current encapsulated content is repeated.
****

.Supported directions:
* `ASC`: sort in ascending order, lower values first (`NULL` values are first).
This is the default sort if no `DIRECTION` is specified.
* `DESC`: sort in ascending order, lower values last (`NULL` values are last).

For the following examples, let us assume that we have a module named `test` with the following fields:

* `quantity` of type `Number`
* `price` of type `Number`
* `name` of type `String`
* `visible` of type `Checkbox`

.To order records, descending by price and ascending by quantity:
[source]
----
price DESC, quantity
----

=== Multi-value fields

[IMPORTANT]
====
Sorting over multi-value fields is currently not supported.
====

== Utilities

.Supported date functions:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#ql-util-fnc-quarter]#<<ql-util-fnc-quarter,`QUARTER`>>#
|
Returns quarter from the given timestamp.

| [#ql-util-fnc-year]#<<ql-util-fnc-year,`YEAR`>>#
|
Returns year from the given timestamp.

| [#ql-util-fnc-date_format]#<<ql-util-fnc-date_format,`DATE_FORMAT`>>#
|
The function returns the date formatted by the provided format.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* add a format reference.
====

| [#ql-util-fnc-date]#<<ql-util-fnc-date,`DATE`>>#
|
Returns date from the given timestamp.
