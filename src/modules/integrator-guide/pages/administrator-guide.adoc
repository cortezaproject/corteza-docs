= Administrator Guide

The administrator guide covers the process of performing administration tasks such as defining roles and role membership, the configuration your security model, and monitoring the system.

This page provides a general overview of the two web applications involved in {PRODUCT_NAME} administration - <<webapp-admin,{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}>> and <<webapp-compose,{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE}>>.
Specific topics are available in the side navigation under the *administrator guide*.

If you haven't yet setup your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance, refer to the xref:devops-guide:index.adoc[].

If you want to learn about low-code application development, refer to the xref:integrator-guide:index.adoc[].

[#webapp-admin]
== {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}

The {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application provides a user interface to perform general system-wide administration tasks such as creating roles, managing role membership, and monitoring the system.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need sufficient permissions to access the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application.
====

.The main administration tasks performed from the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web applications include:
* xref:users.adoc[user] and xref:roles.adoc[role] management,
* security model adjustments by managing xref:authentication/index.adoc[authentication] and xref:access-control/index.adoc[access control],
* the inspection of xref:logging.adoc[log] and xref:automation.adoc[automation] contents to identify and solve configuration issues.

To access the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} web application, go to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance and click on the admin area application.
