:description: Learn how to authenticate external applications using {PRODUCT_NAME}

{PRODUCT_NAME} implements the OAuth2 authentication protocol, where it can act both as a OAuth2 server and as an OAuth2 client, allowing both internal and external authentications.

You can allow external applications to use {PRODUCT_NAME} as an authentication provider as long as they support authentication using OAuth2/OIDC protocols.

After a successful authorization with local credentials or an external provider, an *access token* along with a *refresh token* is issued.
This should be done automatically by the client.

[CAUTION]
====
The access token is short lived and should be automatically refreshed.
You can use our https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-vue/blob/2022.9.x/src/plugins/auth.ts[corteza-vue plugins/auth] to manage this for you.
====

== Configure {PRODUCT_NAME}

Access {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} panel and navigate to menu:system[auth clients].
Create a new auth client which your external application is going to use to authenticate.

[WARNING]
====
We advise you create a separate auth client for each application that you wish to integrate with.
Reusing the same client may grant some integrations access permissions that they should not have.
====

.The Auth client consists of:
. a combination of a client ID and a client secret (the client ID is located in the URL address bar),
. a list of scopes to limit access based on the used Auth client,
. a list of redirection URIs that can be used with authorization code grant,
. a trusted flag to force users to confirm authentication,
. an Auth client validity based on the date.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure to select the appropriate grant type based on your use-case.
Refer to xref:authentication/index.adoc#grant-types[here] for more details.
====

== Configure external application

@todo -- copy the parameters obtained from the auth client into tour external application.

== Authentication lifecycle

The session on the {PRODUCT_NAME} auth is different from the one on the client application.
This separation allows the {PRODUCT_NAME} auth session to be used when authorizing additional clients.

[CAUTION]
====
Since the authentication sessions between different clients are different, each session must be revoked in order for the user to be, in fact, signed-out.
====


== Notes on security

* Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates.
* Authentication forms and endpoints are protected against brute-force and cross-site request attacks.
You can also set your own secrets for JWT, CSRF and cookie value encryption.
* Different expiration durations may be set on sessions temporary and permanent sessions to support your organization's security policies.
* Please see the xref:devops-guide:configuration/server.adoc#_authentication[full list of options].
These changes take affect after server restart.

[NOTE]
====
If any of the secrets are changed, users will receive various warnings and will get logged-out.
====

== Tips for debugging

.If your external application is unable to authenticate:
* client's ID and secret must match,
* at least one of client's redirect URIs must match (by prefix),
* client's grant flow must match,
* client's scope must match (requested group of scopes must intersect with scopes on the client),
* user authorizing the client must be a carrier of a role that is able to authorize the client,
* the user must be valid (confirmed email, unsuspended, undeleted).

| [#auth-term-user]#<<auth-term-user,The user>>#
|
_In OAuth2 terminology, this is a **resource owner**_.

The user authenticates themselves and authorizes the <<auth-term-client,client>> on the authorization server.

| [#auth-term-auth]#<<auth-term-auth,{PRODUCT_NAME} auth server>>#
|
_In OAuth2 terminology this is a **authorization server**_.

The {PRODUCT_NAME} auth authenticates users, authorizes clients and issues access tokens.

[NOTE]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} auth runs side-by-side with {PRODUCT_NAME} API server.
====

| [#auth-term-api]#<<auth-term-api,{PRODUCT_NAME} API>>#
|
_In OAuth2 terminology, this is a **resource server**_

A client must obtain an access token in order to access the resources on the the {PRODUCT_NAME} API.

[NOTE]
====
{PRODUCT_NAME} auth runs side-by-side with {PRODUCT_NAME} API server.

| [#auth-term-client]#<<auth-term-client,Client, Auth Client, Third-Party Application>>#
|
A client is any application that is used to interact with the {PRODUCT_NAME} API.

| [#auth-term-local-credentials]#<<auth-term-local-credentials,Local credentials>>#
|
Local credentials are the email and the password that authenticate the user.

|
An external identity provider is any provider that supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol such as Google, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

|
Security context is a set of roles that are assigned to the user when accessing the {PRODUCT_NAME} API.
