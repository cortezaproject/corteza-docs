:description: Lean how to use external services to authenticate your users

The use of external authentication providers allows your users to use external services (such as Google and GitHub) for authentication purposes.
External providers can be defined in the {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN} panel, under the menu:System[Settings,External authentication providers].

To enable an external authentication provider, you must register {PRODUCT_NAME} as a client using their user interface.
Once you've obtained the user key and secret, you can configure {PRODUCT_NAME} using the admin panel.
External providers become effective immediately without server restart.

== Adjust user role membership

Each of the external authentication provider supports restricting and adjusting user's role membership when a specific external authentication provider is used.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using in combination with security settings on authentication client, settings from the authentication client are applied first, then settings from external authentication provider.
====

To configure role membership, click on the edit icon next to the external authentication provider.
