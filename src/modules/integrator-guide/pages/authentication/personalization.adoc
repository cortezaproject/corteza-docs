:description: Learn how to personalize {PRODUCT_NAME}'s authentication screens to match your brand

All authentication interfaces used by {PRODUCT_NAME} can be fully modified and styled for your needs.
Personalization is performed by defining a series of templates and assets (e.g. images and JavaScript code).
This allows you to make the authentication screen match the company style guide.

== Setup

=== Enabling Personalization

To enable the personalization of the authentication interfaces, you must set the following variables in your `.env` file:

[cols="2s,5a"]
|===
| Variable | Description

| [#env-devmode]#<<env-devmode,`AUTH_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`>>#
| The `AUTH_DEVELOPMENT_MODE` variable enables development tools to help with the interface personalization.
The development tools include automatic template reloading and developer UI.

| [#env-path]#<<env-path,`AUTH_ASSETS_PATH`>>#
| The `AUTH_ASSETS_PATH` variable defines where the system should read the modified authentication interfaces from.
Point the `AUTH_ASSETS_PATH` variable to the directory that contains the modified assets.
To exemplify; `AUTH_ASSETS_PATH=/opt/deploy/corteza/auth-assets`.
|===

[NOTE]
====
The path for the `AUTH_ASSETS_PATH` variable can be absolute or relative to the `corteza-server` binary.
====

=== Export Current Assets

To export the current authentication assets, run the `auth assets export` command.

[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, you can download the assets from https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-server/tree/{{VERSION}}/auth/assets[here].
====

[source]
----
Exports embedded assets into the provided path (must exists)

Usage:
  corteza-server auth assets export [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for export
----

To exemplify; assuming that we will use the `/opt/deploy/corteza/auth-assets` directory, run:

[source]
----
corteza-server auth assets export /opt/deploy/corteza/auth-assets
----

[NOTE]
====
If you've already defined the <<env-path,`AUTH_ASSETS_PATH`>> `.env` variable, you can omit the path when executing the command.
====

The produced output looks like this:

----

[CAUTION]
====
Rerunning the command does not overwrite the existing files.
If you want a fresh start, delete the exported assets and re-export them.
====

== Modifying the Authentication Assets

.The exported assets define the following file structure:
[source]
----
/ public <1>
  / ...
/ templates <2>
  / ---
----
<1> The `/public` subdirectory contains the assets you can use in your authentication screens such as images and stylesheets.
You are free to remove, add or change all of the files in the `/public` subdirectory.
The public files are served in the same format they are defined here in the `/public` subdirectory.
<2> The `/templates` subdirectory contains the HTML templates that are used when displaying the authentication screens.
The templates are written in https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/[go's template syntax].
The syntax is the same as with our xref:templates/index.adoc[document templates].

[WARNING]
====
Template files exported by the CLI command mentioned above should *not* be renamed.
====

If you wish to define reusable components, you can define additional template files (such as the `inc_header.html.tpl` and the `inc_footer.html.tpl`).

=== Change Scenarios

Scenarios can be changed in the `templates/scenarios.yaml` while {PRODUCT_NAME} is running in development mode.

=== Styling

The default stylesheet is included from the Bootstrap CDN in the `inc_header.html.tpl` template.
You are free to change the stylesheet source.

[NOTE]
====
The system doesn't implement automatic style pre-processing or JavaScript transpiling.
You can pre-process the assets with your own tools before using them in the authentication.
====

=== Development Tool

When you enable the <<env-devmode,`AUTH_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`>> `.env` variable, you gain access the development tool accessible under the `$BASE_API_URL/auth/dev` URL.
The development tool displays all of the templates with all of the scenarios.

== Deploying the Changed Assets

Once you enable the <<env-devmode,`AUTH_DEVELOPMENT_MODE`>> `.env` variable, the changed assets deploy automatically.

Disable the variable after you're done with the personalizations.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Do not change the <<env-path,`AUTH_ASSETS_PATH`>> `.env` variable as the templates are read directly from the filesystem.
====

When using docker, make sure to either mount the assets' source as a volume or rebuild a custom image on top of the default image.
