= Corredor helpers

Corredor helpers implement the most common operations, such as creating records and sending emails.

[TIP]
====
Corredor helpers come pre-configured in the xref:integrator-guide:automation-scripts/script-context.adoc#execution-context[execution context].
====

Corredor helpers are context-aware, meaning that they can automatically determine the base parameters required by the operation.
For example, when creating a record, Corredor helpers will know what namespace, module, and record you are using.

[TIP]
====
You can use Corredor helpers outside automation scripts.
