[NOTE]
====
*DevNote*: Add some insight in debugging failing scripts.
====

== Why is it that s script is not valid?

.An automation script is valid when:
* it is defined in a `.js` file,
* located under `client-scripts` or `server-scripts`,
* defines an `export default {...}`,
* defines at least one valid trigger,
* defines a security context in case the script is a sink or deferred,
* conforms to the script signature.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case of a client-script, make sure that the file structure is appropriate.
====

== Why can't I see my scripts?

.Check whether:
* the {APP_AUTOMATION} container has access to the extension, either via an *existing volume*, or a *new volume*.
* you've uploaded your source files to your server,
* you've reloaded your containers.

[TIP]
====
When registering a new volume, you must use `docker-compose up -d`

When using an existing volume, you can use `docker-compose restart`
