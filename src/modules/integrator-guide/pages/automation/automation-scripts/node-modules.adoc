= Node modules

[IMPORTANT]
====
Different extensions *do not share* their dependencies.
If two extensions use *the same dependency*, they both need to *define it*.
====

{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_AUTOMATION} supports internal and external node modules, both on the server-scripts and client-scripts.

[NOTE]
====
Internally, we use the Yarn package manager.
We suggest you do the same.
====

.To add a new node module either:
* manually insert it into the `package.json` file or
* run the `yarn add NAME_GOES_HERE`.

When ran, the {APP_AUTOMATION} server attempts to automatically resolve and install the requested dependencies.

[CAUTION]
====
We are observing some anomalies when running *Yarn inside a docker container*.

If you're getting an error message similar to the one below, it means that Yarn is not able to *install the dependencies*.
This error occurs when Yarn is unable to store its cache.

****
{
  "type": "error",
  "data": "https://registry.yarnpkg.com/rxjs/-/rxjs-6.6.3.tgz: Extracting tar content of undefined failed, the file appears to be corrupt: \\"ENOSPC: no space left on device, write\\""
}
****

.To fix the anomaly, you need to:
. SSH *into the {APP_AUTOMATION} container* (`docker-compose exec -u root corredor sh`),
. `cd` *into the mounted volume*,
. run *`yarn --cache-folder /tmp`*.

The dependencies should now be *installed and available* for use.
The above `yarn` command *manually runs the installing* process, *discarding the cache*.
====

Node modules can then be used *just like in any other situation*.

.Example package.json:
[source,json]
----
{
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "^0.18.0"
  }
}
----

.Example usage from automation scripts:
[source,js]
----
import axios from 'axios'

export default {
  // ...

  async exec() {
    await axios.get(...)

    // ...
  }
}
----
