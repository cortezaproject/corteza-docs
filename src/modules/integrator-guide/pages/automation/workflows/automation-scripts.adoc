= Executing automation scripts

A workflow allows you to execute automation scripts registered with the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.
The capability to execute automation scripts can come in handy when you need to implement complex business logic, but still wish to keep the nice visual description of a workflow.

== The automation script

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the xref:automation/automation-scripts/index.adoc[] for details regarding automation script internals and how to deploy them to the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.
====

The automation script must define a *manual trigger for the system resource*.
Feel free to use the following example as a starting point.

./server-scripts/invoked-from-the-workflow.js
[source,js]
----
export default {
  label: 'Called From Workflow',
  description: 'This script will be called from workflow function',
  triggers ({ on }) {
    /**
     * Due to how the Corredor scripting system is designed right now,
     * triggers still need to be defined (even if the script is
     * executed explicitly from the workflow)
     */
    return on('manual').for('system')
  },

  exec (args, { logger }) {
    logger.info('success')
  }
}
----

== The workflow

To execute an automation-script, add a function step image:workflow/function.svg[width=20px] that calls the `Corredor automation script executor` function.
Insert the *script reference* under the script argument.

.The script reference can be obtained by:
* Navigating to the menu:{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_ADMIN}[Automation,{APP_AUTOMATION} scripts] and find the automation script you wish to execute and copy its reference.
* Construct it manually using the pattern of `/server-scripts/path-to/the-script/script-name.js:default`.
For the example above, the reference is `/server-scripts/invoked-from-the-workflow.js:default`.

Refer to the xref:automation/automation-scripts/index.adoc[] documentation if you can't see your automation scripts.

Place a trigger image:workflow/trigger.svg[width=20px] and connect it to the function step you've defined earlier.

To test if everything is working correctly, click on the run icon in the top right corner of the trigger.
If everything worked correctly, you should see a `"success"` string logged by the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.

== Passing custom arguments

Add an expression step image:workflow/expressions.svg[width=20px] between the trigger and the function step.

.Define the following expressions:
[source]
----
scriptArgs          (Vars) <1>
scriptArgs.from     (Boolean) = false <2>
scriptArgs.workflow (String)  = "some string" <3>
----
<1> Define a new set of variables that will be passed to the automation script.
<2> Define a `from` variable with the value of `false`.
<3> Define a `workflow` variable with the value of `"some string"`.

Update the function step and set the `args` argument to `scriptArgs` (the variables we've defined in the expression step).

.The automation script can access the prepared arguments like so:
[source,js]
----
export default {
  label: 'Called From Workflow',
  description: 'This script will be called from workflow function',
  triggers ({ on }) {
    /**
     * Due to how the Corredor scripting system is designed right now,
     * triggers still need to be defined (even if the script is
     * executed explicitly from the workflow)
     */
    return on('manual').for('system')
  },

  exec (args, { logger }) {
    // unpack arguments
    const { from, workflow } = args

    // log all arguments
    logger.info('these are the special arguments we received', { from, workflow })
  }
}
----

To test if everything is working correctly, click on the run icon in the top right corner of the trigger.
If everything worked correctly, you should see a `'these are the special arguments we received' { from: false, workflow: 'some string' }` string logged by the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.

== Reading execution result

In the function step that executes the automation script, specify the target variable to collect the output of the automation script.
The automation script should return an object.

[CAUTION]
====
Standard automation script rules for return values apply.
If the automation script returns a `false`, we consider this an `Abort` signal and the workflow results with an error.
====

.An example of an automation script that returns a result:
[source,js]
----
export default {
  // ...

  exec (args, { logger }) {
    logger.info('returning some values from the script')
    return {
      a: 123,
      b: true
    }
  }
}
