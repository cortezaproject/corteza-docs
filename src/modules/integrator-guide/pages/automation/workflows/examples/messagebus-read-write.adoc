= Messagebus Queue
:attachment-path: ../../../_attachments/automation/workflows/
:page-noindex: true

Messagebus queue mechanism complements the workflows in a way that any asynchronous computation can be offloaded to another workflow or workflow-extendable process.
More info on the described topics can be found at xref:automation/workflows/index.adoc[], Integration Gateway xref:api-gw/profiler.adoc[] and the xref:developer-guide:corteza-server/messagebus.adoc[] subsystem.

.In this example we will:
* create a queue
* create an endpoint
* write to queue via workflow
* read from queue via workflow
** send a payload to an endpoint
* view endpoint payload in profiler

== Create a new Queue

[IMPORTANT]
====
The `Consumer` here should be `Eventbus`, since this is how the internal mechanism provides the payload data to the {PRODUCT_NAME} subsystems, including Workflows.

.The screenshot shows the creation of the queue in UI.

== Write to Queue

This is a workflow we will use just to manually trigger the write to queue.

[NOTE]
====
You can either use any of the automation buttons to trigger this workflow from the UI.
Usually the case would be after creating a record and then sending the new recordID to the queue.
====

The payload is defined as an `Array` that is then stringified
[source,json]
----
toJSON([
  {"key":"foo", "value": "bar"},
  {"key":"bar", "value": "baz"}
])

== Read from Queue

Here we parse the queue payload and create a custom HTTP request to an outside, ie. Kafka (in our example an endpoint we will create for this purpose only).

== Create a mock service endpoint

What we need now is to trigger the `Queue Write` workflow and a request will be sent to our local server on the `/api/gateway/example_kafka` endpoint.

The resulting request can be seen on the Integration Gateway profiler (if you have it enabled, see more at xref:api-gw/profiler.adoc[]).

== Preview the request in the Profiler

This preview is for example only, a way to use the profiler to debug any sending payloads to production / external services.

.Preview the request headers and other metadata.
