*@todo*

An automation session describes an automation that has executed or is still executing.
Sessions can be used to debug a failing automation and to identify any infinite cycling issues preventing the system from working properly.

.To list current sessions:
. Navigate to menu:system[sessions],
. optionally insert the filtering parameters (the list refreshes automatically).
