:description: Lean how to use workflows for visual business logic configuration based on a simplified BPMN model

{PRODUCT_NAME} workflow allows you to implement custom business logic without the need for any programming knowledge.
This section focuses on the most important aspects of the system.
If you wish to learn more about a specific topic, refer to the subsections under menu:Low-Code Platform Developer Guide[Automation,Workflows].

In contrast to xref:automation/automation-scripts/index.adoc[automation scripts], workflows are presented as a simplified BPMN diagram, allowing you to configure instead of code.
You are not required to have any BPMN knowledge, although it might be helpful.

// [IMPORTANT]
// ====
// All of the data in the workflow is typed.
// Refer to xref:automation/workflows/types.adoc[type index] for more details.

== Create a new workflow

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* how to include the flow from the admin panel?
====

To create a workflow, navigate to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance (for example http://latest.cortezaproject.org/) and click ok tne "Workflows" application.

.The screenshot indicates how to access the workflow web application.

When you click on the *btn:[New Workflow]* button, a new screen will appear with an open modal window, where you should insert initial parameters to describe the workflow.

* *Label* provides a user-friendly identifier for the workflow, for example "Test Workflow".
A label doesn't define any special constraints.
* *Handle* defines a <<wf-handle-constraints,unique value>> that may be used instead of the system identifier for easier referencing.
* *Description* defines a verbose description of the workflow in order to better explain what the workflow does.
* *Run as* defines which user should be used when executing this workflow (the invoking user).

== About the workflow editor

The workflow editor consists of four main parts; workflow configuration screen, toolbar, canvas, and step configurator.

. *Workflow configuration* (accessible by clicking on the configuration icon {ICON_WORKFLOW_COG} in the header) is where you provide basic workflow configurations.
. *Toolbar* is where you can find all of the available steps.
. *Canvas* is where you can build and configure the workflow.
. *Step configurator* is where you can configure the workflow steps.

.The workflow editor user interface.
image::automation/workflows/editor.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

=== Structure the workflow

To start building your workflow, simply drag-and-drop different elements (further referred to as steps) from the toolbar to the canvas.
If you are using similar steps with similar configurations, using copy-paste to duplicate existing steps might be faster (kbd:[cmd+c] and kbd:[cmd+v]).

.Example of adding a new step from the toolbar to the canvas.
image::automation/workflows/step-add.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

To define the flow of your workflow, simply connect the steps by drawing a connector between them.

.Example of connecting two steps.
image::automation/workflows/step-connect.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

To change the start point or the end point of the connector, click on the connector to view its points; then hover over the connecting point and drag it to another connector point.

.Example of changing the origin connector point.
image::automation/workflows/step-connect-move-from.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

.Example of changing the destination connector point.
image::automation/workflows/step-connect-move-to.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

Add some extra steps to get the feel for the interface.
The resulting workflow doesn't need to be valid or make any sense.
All of the available steps and their configuration will be addressed in detail in the following sections.

.Gesture reference:
* Click and hold the right mouse button, drag the mouse to *pan the canvas*.
* Scroll up to *zoom in the canvas* (inverted when natural scrolling is enabled).
* Scroll down to *zoom out the canvas* (inverted when natural scrolling is enabled).

[TIP]
====
The remaining gestures and keyboard shortcuts can be found in the help menu.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Remember, every workflow must start with a trigger {ICON_WORKFLOW_TRIGGER}.
The termination step {ICON_WORKFLOW_TERMINATION} is optional, but may increase clarity.
A single workflow can have multiple triggers and multiple termination steps.
====

When you're satisfied with your workflow or wish to save your progress, click on the save button on the bottom of the screen, or use the kbd:[ctrl+s] shortcut.

.The screenshot shows how to save the workflow.
image::automation/workflows/save.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

=== Configuring the workflow

Without any configuration, most workflow steps don't do anything unless we configure them to perform some task such as evaluating an expression or executing a complex function.

In order to configure specific steps, click on the configuration icon {ICON_WORKFLOW_COG} in the header of the step.
To configure a specific connector, click on its label or double click on it.

The configuration is automatically saved to the step.
The workflow needs to be saved in order for the configuration to take affect.

.The screenshot shows the step connector for the expression step.
image::automation/workflows/step-config.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

== Execution control

Execution control allows you to indicate where the workflow starts, its steps, and where the workflow ends.

[#step-exec-triggers]
=== Triggers

A *trigger* {ICON_WORKFLOW_TRIGGER} defines when the workflow is executed and what steps the workflow execution should perform.

[TIP]
====
A single workflow can have multiple triggers.
Multiple triggers allow you to define fewer workflows for different events.
====

Every time an action occurs (e.g. a record is created or a user signed-up) the system finds all of the workflows with a trigger that conform to that operation.
To exemplify; when a client signs-up for your newsletter, the system finds all of the workflows where the trigger listens to a "user signed up" event.

.A trigger consists of four main components (click on the configuration icon in the header):
. a *resource* which specifies what system resource the trigger reacts to,
. an *event* which specifies what system events the trigger reacts to,
. a series of *constraints* which specify how an event should look like in order for the trigger to react.
** To exemplify; we can react to a {PRODUCT_NAME} created event only when the record was created for a lead module under the CRM namespace,
. an *initial scope* which specifies what variables are available to the workflow as soon as it is executed.
When working with records this is the current record, the previous version of it, the related module, the related namespace, and any record validation errors.

[TIP]
====
Constraint your triggers as much as possible to prevent your workflows from executing when they shouldn't.
====

[#step-exec-terminator]
=== Terminators

A *termination step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_TERMINATION} terminates the execution of a workflow.

[CAUTION]
====

In the example above, when any of the long running tasks finishes, the entire workflow will be terminated and the other long running task gets canceled.

Refer to xref:automation/workflows/examples/parallelism.adoc[] for details.
====

The termination step is not required, and is implied wherever the workflow is unable to continue due to the lack of steps.

[TIP]
====
A single workflow can have multiple termination steps.
Multiple termination steps allow you to explicitly terminate the execution of a workflow.

[#expressions]
== Expressions

An *expression step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_EXPRESSIONS} defines a set of expressions which allow you to directly interact with values defined in your workflow.
Think of this as defining an equation in spreadsheets.

A single expression step can define multiple expressions, allowing you to aggregate similar operations under a single step; this reduces the size and increases readability.
Refer to xref:expr/index.adoc[] for more details regarding expression definition.

.Examples of usage:
* generate a full name for a contact,
* calculate the grand total for a quote,
* copy values from one record to another.

To configure the expression step, click on the configuration icon {ICON_WORKFLOW_COG} in the header of the expression step.

[#functions]
== Functions

A *function step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_FUNCTION} defines what operation should be performed when the function step is executed.
Think of this as defining a macro in spreadsheets.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you're using logging functions, make sure to correctly set your environment variables.
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:troubleshooting/logging.adoc[DevOps guide] for details.
====

.Examples of usage:
* create a new quote for an account,
* send an email notification to your mailing list,
* delete a suspended user.

[NOTE]
====
Functions that are not natively supported by workflows can be implemented with xref:automation/automation-scripts/index.adoc[automation scripts].
An automation script can be xref:automation/workflows/automation-scripts.adoc[executed from a workflow].

The function step in the above example creates a log entry based on the provided `message` and `fields` arguments.

.Function arguments can be passed in two different ways:
. *Constant values* which are passed into function in their present condition.
Use constant values when the passed data should not change.
. *Expressions* are evaluated and the result is passed into function.
This is useful when you wish to change the input without the need for an additional expression step.

// check vv
// Use expressions when the passed data should change based on the workflows' scope.

[#processing-multiple-items]
== Processing multiple items

When you wish to process multiple items, such as a list of leads that were created in the past month, you should use an *iterator* {ICON_WORKFLOW_ITERATOR}.
An iterator allows you to sequentially process a series of items one after another.

An iterator consists of two main parts; the *configuration* and the *iterator body*.

=== Iterator configuration

To access the iterator configuration, click on the configuration icon {ICON_WORKFLOW_COG} in the header.
The configuration consists of three parts; *type*, *arguments*, and *result* parts.

[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#step-iterator-type]#<<step-iterator-type,Iterator type>>#
|
From the end-user's perspective, the iterator type specifies what arguments you need to provide in order to process the requested set of items.
We characterise three main kinds of iterators:

[#iterator-kind-condition]#<<iterator-kind-condition,Condition iterators>>#::
  A condition iterator repeats for as long as the condition you've provided results as truthy.
  To examplify; a condition of `counter < 10` would make the iterator repeat for as long as the counter is below 10.

[#iterator-kind-item]#<<iterator-kind-item,Item iterators>>#::
  An item iterator traverses the provided set of items from start to finish.
  To examplify; we pass in 10 records, therefore the iterator repeats 10 times, once for each record in the provided set.

[TIP]
====
Most item iterators are able to *fetch and iterate* over items.
====

[#iterator-kind-stream]#<<iterator-kind-stream,Stream iterators>>#::
  A stream iterator traverses the provided file one line at a time.
  To exemplify; we provide a text document containing 10 email addresses each in its own line, therefore the iterator repeats 10 times, once for each line (in this case email address).

[CAUTION]
====
Be careful when using the stream iterator with arbitrary file types.
File types and encodings may cause unwanted behavior.
====

| [#step-iterator-args]#<<step-iterator-args,Iterator arguments>>#
|
Iterator arguments allow you to specify the data that the iterator is allowed to work with.

.Iterator arguments can be passed in two different ways:
. *Constant values* are passed into the iterator function in its present condition.
Use constant values when the passed data should not change.
. *Expressions* are evaluated and the result is passed into the iterator.
This is useful when you wish to change the input without the need for an additional expression step.

// check vv
// Use expressions when the passed data should change based on the workflows' scope.

| [#step-iterator-rsp]#<<step-iterator-rsp,Iterator results>>#
|
During the execution of an iterator a set of results for each iteration is generated.
The results depend on the iterator type.

|===

=== Iterator body

The iterator body is implied by the first outgoing connector.
The second connector indicates where the execution continues after the iterator executes.

[NOTE]
====
Note the "body" and the "end" labels on the outgoing connectors.
====

Use the iterator body to define what should happen to the items in processing, for example; if our intent is to send out email notifications, this is where you do that.

The iterator body is implicitly terminated by the continue {ICON_WORKFLOW_CONTINUE} step if neither of the iterator execution control steps are used prior.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Use either the continue or break steps to terminate the loop body.
The advised approach is less prone to errors such as infinite loops.
Do not create a loop using connectors.

.An example of a valid iterator body.
image::automation/workflows/iterator-body-do.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.An example of an invalid iterator body.
image::automation/workflows/iterator-body-dont.png[role="data-zoomable"]

====

=== Controlling iterator execution

There may be cases where you would like to prematurely terminate the ongoing iteration or the entire iterator all together.
This can be done using the break {ICON_WORKFLOW_BREAK} or the continue {ICON_WORKFLOW_CONTINUE} steps.

[CAUTION]
====
The break and the continue steps are only valid within *iterator bodies*.
====

[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#step-iterator-control-continue]#<<step-iterator-control-continue,Continue>>#
|
The continue step {ICON_WORKFLOW_CONTINUE} terminates the ongoing iteration and continues with the potential following iteration.
The continue step should be used to either prematurely terminate the iterator body or when the iterator body is considered as completed.

[#working-with-errors]
== Error handling

Whenever you work with dynamic data (especially end-user input) and external services, you are always reminded that errors can and will occur.
We define two steps for working with errors; *error handler step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_ERROR_HANDLER} and *error step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_ERROR}.

[#step-errors-catch]
=== Error handler

An *error handler step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_ERROR_HANDLER} allows you to catch and react to any errors that may occur in continuation of the workflow.

[NOTE]
====
Think of this as a try-catch.

----

The steps in the red zone can be considered as dangerous (can fail).
If any step in the "dangerous" zone fails, the execution continues along the "Catch" connected steps.

[#step-errors-throw]
=== Error

An *error step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_ERROR} allows you to manually trigger an error during the execution of a workflow.
Forcefully terminating the workflow using an error step prevents additional operations from executing (such as the record is not saved or a user is not suspended).

[NOTE]
====
Think of the error step as raising an error or an exception.

== Gateways

Gateways allow you to implement conditional execution based on the ongoing state of your workflow, for example, if a current user is already a subscriber, we should send a renewal request instead of a subscription request.

There are three kinds of gateway steps; *exclusive* {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYEXCLUSIVE}, *inclusive* {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYINCLUSIVE}, and *fork* {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYPARALLEL}.

[CAUTION]
====
The break and the continue steps are not supported for gateways.
If the gateway is nested within an iterator, the iterator will be affected instead.
====

[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#step-gateway-exclusive]#<<step-gateway-exclusive,Exclusive>>#

An *exclusive gateway* {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYEXCLUSIVE} defines two or more connectors.
Only the first connector that meets the condition is evaluated.
Connectors are evaluated in the order they were initially defined in.

| [#step-gateway-inclusive]#<<step-gateway-inclusive,Inclusive>>#
|
An *inclusive gateway* inclusive {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYINCLUSIVE} defines two or more connectors.
Any connector that meets the condition is evaluated.

| [#step-gateway-fork]#<<step-gateway-fork,Fork>>#
|
A *fork gateway* {ICON_WORKFLOW_GATEWAYPARALLEL} defines two or more connectors.
Each connector is evaluated and executed in parallel.

[IMPORTANT]
====
All of the different "branches" created by a fork must be collected using a second fork step.

=== Important notes

[cols="2s,5a"]
|===
| [#gw-note-inclusive-join]#<<gw-note-inclusive-join,Inclusive and join gateways>>#
|
When using inclusive gateways with join gateways, the workflow may run indefinitely.

The join step waits for all of the inbound paths to resolve.
If any one of the inclusive paths does not resolve, the join gateway never resolves, and the workflow runs indefinitely.

[NOTE]
====
Workflow execution, by design, does not timeout unless forcefully terminated.
====

You can resolve this by reworking your workflow logic to avoid such cases.

== Interacting with the user

[CAUTION]
====
Any workflow that uses a prompt step {ICON_WORKFLOW_PROMPT} is treated as asynchronous.
Refer to the xref:automation/execution-flow-details.adoc#exec-flow-implicit[] for potential implications.
====

The *prompt step* {ICON_WORKFLOW_PROMPT} allows you to interact with the user in order to provide additional confirmation or data, such as a recipient email address or filling in any missing parameters.

.The different prompt types:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===
| [#step-prompt-redirect]#<<step-prompt-redirect,External redirect>>#
|
An *external redirect* redirects the receiving user to the specified URL anywhere on the internet.

[TIP]
====
You can use this prompt to initiate download procedures.
====

| [#step-prompt-reroute]#<<step-prompt-reroute,Internal redirect>>#
|
An *internal redirect prompt* redirects the receiving user to the specified route on the current web application.
Refer to the `/src/views/routes.js` JS file of each {PRODUCT_NAME} web application for a complete list of available routes and their parameters.

| [#step-prompt-recordPage]#<<step-prompt-recordPage,Record page redirect>>#
|
A *record page redirect prompt* redirects the receiving user to the specified record page.
This can be used to redirect the user to the newly created record.

| [#step-prompt-notification]#<<step-prompt-notification,Notification>>#
|
A *notification prompt* displays a notification to the receiving user but is dismissed immediately when shown.
This can be used to show success or other informative notifications.

| [#step-prompt-alert]#<<step-prompt-alert,Alert>>#
|
An *alert prompt* displays a notification to the receiving user.
This can be used to show success or other informative notifications.

| [#step-prompt-choice]#<<step-prompt-choice,Choice>>#
|
A *choice prompt* displays a notification with two buttons to either confirm or reject something to the receiving user.
This can be used to request additional confirmation before performing an operation or to optionally perform additional operations.

| [#step-prompt-input]#<<step-prompt-input,Single input>>#
|
A *single input prompt* displays a notification with a value input box to the receiving user.
This can be used to request additional information from the receiving user, such as missing contact data or their pin code.

| [#step-prompt-options]#<<step-prompt-options,Option select>>#
|
An *option select prompt* displays a notification with a list of available options either as a select or a list of radio buttons.
This can be used as a more verbose <<step-prompt-choice,choice prompt>> or a more constrained <<step-prompt-input,input prompt>>.

== Delay and schedule workflows

{PRODUCT_NAME} workflow allows you to schedule or delay its execution.
This can be a powerful tool when working with external services that throttle their API usage or when a task should be performed in an interval, for example monthly subscription renewal.

To achieve this, you are provided with a delay step {ICON_WORKFLOW_DELAY} and a deferred trigger {ICON_WORKFLOW_TRIGGER}.

****
When you use a delay or a prompt step, the workflow becomes asynchronous and can no longer invalidate actions like create, update, or delete a record.

Operations such as "confirm record creation" are currently not possible with workflows.
If you need to perform value validation or sanitization, use xref:compose-configuration/index.adoc#module-field-expr[field expressions] instead.
****

=== The delay of execution

The delay step {ICON_WORKFLOW_DELAY} allows you to explicitly pause the workflow's execution for a set period of time.

This type of delaying is common when working with APIs that throttle their access.
To exemplify; let's say that the API allows 10 calls per minute and we wish to fetch 100 items.
A possible execution is as it follows:

image::automation/workflows/delay-example.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

[NOTE]
====
In case you wish to wait for an action performed by a user (such as a confirmation), use a xref:automation/workflows/index.adoc#user-interaction[prompt step] instead.
====

=== Execution scheduling

Execution scheduling is performed by configuring the trigger {ICON_WORKFLOW_TRIGGER} to run in an <<deferred-interval,interval>> or at a specific <<deferred-timestamp,timestamp>>.

[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#deferred-interval]#<<deferred-interval,Interval>>#
|
An interval trigger allows you to run the workflow in a specified interval.
This can be used to perform routine daily tasks or process larger data in batches.

A good example is a subscription service where it is necessary to renew the subscriptions of the clients on a monthly basis.
We define an interval that executes the workflow each day, determine what clients need to be renewed that day and renew them.

image::automation/workflows/interval-example.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

[WARNING]
====
The form of the above example should not be used in production.
The actual workflow should implement error handling, transaction logging, and email notifications.
====

To define an interval trigger, click on the click on the configuration icon {ICON_WORKFLOW_COG} and specify the system as the resource resource with the on interval event.

The interval is defined as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron[chron expression] and can be extremely flexible.
You can also use https://crontab.guru/[this amazing tool] to verify that your expressions are valid.

.Common cron examples:
* every hour at minute 0: `0 * * * *`
* every 30 minutes (0 and 30): `0/30 * * * *`
* every day at the start of the day: `0 0 * * *`
* every month at the start of month: `0 0 1 * *`

[TIP]
====
You can define multiple intervals under the same trigger.
====

| [#deferred-timestamp]#<<deferred-timestamp,Timestamp>>#
|
A timestamped trigger allows you to run the workflow at a specified time.

To illustrate; you have just received a new client that requested a series of deadlines where they would like to see the current progress.
We could define a scheduled workflow that is executed at each one of the timestamps.
The workflow would aggregate all of the completed tickets into an email and send it off to the client.

image::automation/workflows/schedule-example.svg[role="data-zoomable"]

Timestamps are defined in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601[ISO 8601, `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ` format].

[TIP]
====
You can define multiple timestamps under the same trigger.
