:description: Learn how to process record selection using workflows

Record lists allow you to enable record selection, allowing you to perform automation over a series of records.

[#wf-config]
== Workflow configuration

.To configure a workflow which supports record selection:
. navigate to the {APP_NAME_WORKFLOW} application and either create or edit a workflow,
. add a trigger with a resource of either `Compose Page` or `Compose Record`,

The workflow receives a `selected` scope variable which defines a list of selected record IDs.
To examplify; the `selected` scope variable may contain a list of `[ '1111', '2222', ..., 'nnnn' ]`.

You can use an item iterator to traverse through the list of selected records.
From there you can use functions and expressions to implement your feature.

== {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you already have some automation which can be used by the record list.
Refer to <<wf-config,workflow configuration>> for details.
