= Data Access Layer

The {PRODUCT_NAME} Data access Layer(also referred to as DAL) extends and expands  Cortezaâ€™s capabilities to store and read data from primary and external databases.

The data access layer helps us isolate( separation of concerns) our code from the presentation and business layers. 
We use the data access layer to pull data from different data stores (database server, flat files, web services, whatever else).

[TIP]
====
When changing the underlying database, for example, moving from one relational database like PostgreSQL to MySQL and then abstracting the underlying database is crucial.
{PRODUCT_NAME} data access layer enables you to make the change with ease.
