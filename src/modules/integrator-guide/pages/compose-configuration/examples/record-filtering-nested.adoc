= Record Filtering With Nested Fields
:page-noindex: true

{PRODUCT_NAME} doesn't natively support filtering using values from referenced values, such as records and users.

Let us use an example where we have two modules: `user` and `package` where each `user` can have a `package`.
We wish to find only the users that have a specific package.

You can use one of the following workarounds.

== Clone the child fields into the parent

Extend the `user` module to add a new field, for example, `filter__package_name`.
You can add additional fields if you wish to use multiple fields.

Define an xref:automation/index.adoc[automation] with a before create/update trigger for the `user` module.

The automation fetches the related package of the user in question and populates the newly created `filter__package_name` field with the `name` field from the corresponding `package` record.

When searching for users, refer to the `filter__package_name` field.

== Perform multiple fetches

[IMPORTANT]
====
This option only applies if you're searching for records outside of the existing web applications.
====

Instead of performing one fetch, you can perform multiple fetches.

Firstly fetch the `package` records based on some query.

.The response would look something like this:
[source,json]
----
[{
  "recordID": "1"
},
{
  "recordID": "2"
}]
----

Next, fetch the `user` records where the query limits the users only to the records obtained in the previous query.

.To exemplify, the query would look like this:
[source]
----
`package='1' OR package='2'`
----
