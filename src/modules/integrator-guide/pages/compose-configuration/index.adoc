:description: Learn how to configure your {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} application using {PRODUCT_NAME}

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides a powerful Low-Code development platform allowing you to setup your application with ease.
{PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} allows you to extend {PRODUCT_NAME} and support your business needs.

With {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} we define the logical data structure, how the data is displayed, and how it should be visualized.
The second part is the xref:automation/index.adoc[automation] process, which allows you to implement custom business logic and automate tasks.

If you wish to learn more about a specific topic, refer to the subsections under menu:Low-Code Platform Developer Guide[{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration].

== App configuration

[#config-namespaces]
=== Create a new namespace

A *namespace* is a container for the configuration and the data specific to an application, such as a CRM.
A namespace uses <<config-modules,modules>> to define the data structure, <<config-pages,pages>> to define how the data is displayed, and <<config-charts,charts>> to visualize the data.

[IMPORTANT]
====
A namespace *can not* directly access data from another namespace.
If this is needed, consider implementing this using xref:automation/index.adoc[automation] to programmatically define the interaction.
====

To create a new namespace, navigate to your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance (for example http://latest.cortezaproject.org/) and click on the {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} application.

|
The namespace name is the human-friendly label that is shown when identifying the namespace.
The name should be short and descriptive.

| [#ns-param-slug]#<<ns-param-slug,Short name>>#
|
The short name (slug) is a unique human-friendly system identifier for the namespace that can be used instead of the namespace ID when referencing the namespace.

.The short name is usually a variation of the full name that must conform to the following constraints:
include::partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]

| [#ns-param-enable]#<<ns-param-enable,Enable on namespace list>>#
|
The enabled flag controls if the namespace is enabled and can be accessed.
When disabled, the namespace is still visible, but can not be accessed.

| [#ns-param-enable-app]#<<ns-param-enable-app,Enable on application list>>#
|
The enabled application flag controls if the namespace should be immediately treated as an application and shown on the app selector.

| [#ns-param-logo]#<<ns-param-logo,Logo>>#
|
The namespace logo input allows you to upload a custom logo for the specific namespace.
The default logo is the one defined in the theme.

image:compose-configuration/ns-empty.png[width=49%]

[#config-modules]
=== Creating a new module

A *module* defines the shape of a record and provides a container for the records, such as an account or a contact.
A module uses a series for <<module-field,module fields>> to define the records' structure and a <<config-record-page,record page>> to define how the record is presented to the user.

When configuring a new namespace, you are presented with an onboarding screen from where you can click on the btn:[Create Module] button to create your first module.

If you wish to add additional modules, or are configuring an already existing namespace, navigate to menu:Admin panel[Modules], and click on the btn:[New Module] button.

image::compose-configuration/module-create.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.From the module editor screen you can:
* Edit the module metadata,
* edit <<module-fields,module fields>> for the given module,
* edit xref:compose-configuration/record-storage.adoc[DAL connection parameters] and privacy settings for the given module,
* configure xref:compose-configuration/duplication-detection.adoc[duplicate detection] for the given module,
* configure xref:compose-configuration/record-revisions.adoc[record revisions] for the given module,
* manage permissions for the given module by clicking on the btn:[Permissions] button,
* manage module field permissions for the given module by clicking on the btn:[Field permissions] button.

.Available module parameters:
[cols="2s,5a"]
|===

| [#mod-param-name]#<<mod-param-name,Name>>#
|
The module name is a user-friendly label that is shown when identifying the module.
The name should be short and descriptive.

| [#mod-param-handle]#<<mod-param-handle,Handle>>#
|
The short name (handle) is a unique user-friendly *system identifier* that can be used instead of the module ID when referencing the module.

.The handle is usually a variation of the full name and therefore must conform to the following constraints:
include::partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]

|===

[#generate-synthetic-data]
=== Generate synthetic data for a module

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides a tool to generate synthetic data for a module.
You can use it to generate a large amount of data for a module to test the application's performance or to demonstrate the implementation.

The tool is currently only available in the command line interface (CLI) and supports synthetic data generation for {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} records (`compose records synthetic`) and users (`users synthetic`).

Generated records are flagged with `synthetic:true` in the record's meta field, and users will have their handles prefixed with `synthetic_` and email domain `synthetic.tld`.

==== Usage

.Show help for synthetic {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} record generator:
[source,shell]
----
corteza-server compose records synthetic --help
----

.Generate 10 leads in the crm namespace:
[source,shell]
----
corteza-server compose records synthetic generate --namespace crm --module lead --total 10
----

.Remove all synthetic records in leads module in the crm namespace:
[source,shell]
----
corteza-server compose records synthetic rm --namespace crm --module lead
----

[#config-record-page]
=== Creating record pages

A *record page* defines how the data is presented to the user when viewing, creating and editing records for that module.
A record page consists of a series of page blocks that are defined with the <<page-builder,page builder>>.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In case your module does not define a record page, you are not able to create or update its records through the user interface.

You are still able to view its records, create the records using inline record lists, the API, or an xref:automation/index.adoc[automation].
====

A record page is tied to the specified module, and to the record it is pointing to.
This allows you to configure the page blocks to react to the currently viewed record for dynamic resource filtering.

[TIP]
====
You can utilize xref:compose-configuration/page-layouts.adoc[page layouts] for even more flexibility on how users interact with the data.
====

The record page can be created directly from the module edit screen by clicking on the btn:[Create record page] button.

[#config-charts]
=== Creating charts

A *chart* defines how a specific modules' records are visualized.
A chart is bound to your module and allows you to aggregate and transform the data which is then visualized on a chart.

[NOTE]
====
One chart can only show records of one module.
====

If you're configuring a new namespace, you are presented with an onboarding screen from where you can click on the btn:[Create Chart] button to create your first chart.

If you wish to add additional charts or are configuring an already configured namespace, navigate to menu:Admin panel[Charts], then click on the btn:[New Chart] button.

image::compose-configuration/chart-create.png[role="data-zoomable"]

.{PRODUCT_NAME} defines three chart categories:
* <<chart-generic,Generic charts>> which include the usual line, bar, pie, and doughnut charts,
* <<chart-funnel,funnel charts>> which define the funnel chart,
* <<chart-gauge,gauge charts>> which define the gauge chart.

Refer to the chart specific sub-sections for more details

.From the chart editor screen you can:
* Edit the chart metadata,
* edit the charts' report configuration,
* edit the charts' visual representation.

[#config-list-pages]
=== Creating list pages

A *list page* defines how the application is presented to the user when interacting with it.
A list page consists of a series of page blocks that are defined with the <<page-builder,page builder>>.

In contrast to record pages, list pages are broader and only bound to the namespace they are on.
They are general purpose and used to provide access to different record pages via record lists, dashboards, and other layouts.

When configuring a new namespace, you are presented with an onboarding screen.
From there you click on the btn:[Build Page] button in order to create your first page.

[TIP]
====
You can utilize xref:compose-configuration/page-layouts.adoc[page layouts] for even more flexibility on how users interact with the data.
====

If you wish to add additional pages or you are configuring an already configured namespace, navigate to menu:Admin panel[Pages], and click on the btn:[New Page] button.
From there you can click on the btn:[Page builder] button to enter the <<page-builder,page builder>>

.Available page parameters:
[cols="2s,5a"]
|===

|
The page title is a label that is shown when viewing the page and when displaying the page navigation.
The page title should be short and descriptive.

| [#pg-list-param-handle]#<<pg-list-param-handle,Handle>>#
|
The short name (handle) is a unique, user-friendly system identifier for the module.
It can be used instead of the page ID when referencing the page.

.The handle is usually a variation of the title and therefore must conform to the following constraints:
include::partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]

|===

[#config-navigation]
=== Structuring the navigation

The page navigation of your application is generated based on your list pages and their position in the *page tree*.
Navigate to the menu:Admin panel[Pages] to see your current pages and how they are structured.

To *change the order of pages*, drag and drop the page to the desired position.

[#module-field]
== Module fields

A *module field* defines the shape of the modules' records (what parameters will we store), what data type specific parameters are, and additional settings to control how the field should behave.
Each module can have multiple module fields.

To edit module fields, navigate to menu:Admin panel[Modules] and click on the module you wish to edit.
The module fields are listed in the "manage module fields" section, below the module metadata.

.A detailed breakdown of module fields:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#module-field-name]#<<module-field-name,Name>>#
|
A field name defines how the value is stored internally and what key is used when accessing the value from an automation.

[CAUTION]
====
Once a module is populated with at least one record, the name can not be changed.
====

A field name should be short and descriptive.
There is *a limit of 64 characters* imposed.

.A name field must conform tho the following constraints:
include::partial$handle-constraints.adoc[]

| [#module-field-title]#<<module-field-title,Title>>#
|
A field title defines what label is used when presenting the field and the value to the user.

The field name should be short, descriptive, and modeled after the field title.
If you omit the title, the <<module-field-name,name>> is used instead.

| [#module-field-type]#<<module-field-type,Type>>#
|
A field type defines what type of data the field stores.
For example, if we wish to store email addresses of our users, the field type will be `Email`.

Refer to the xref:compose-configuration/field-types.adoc[] section for more details regarding field types.

| [#module-field-settings-base]#<<module-field-settings-base,Base field settings>>#
|
Base field settings control the general behavior of the module field.
Base field settings are accessible directly under the "Attributes" column of the module field list.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When exporting multi-value fields into the CSV format, only the *first value* is exported.
====

| [#module-field-settings-ts]#<<module-field-settings-ts,Type specific field settings>>#
|
Type-specific field settings control the behavior of the module field based on the <<module-field-type,field type>>.

To access type-specific settings, click on the btn:[settings icon] next to the field type and navigate to the second tab (the one with the same name as the field type).

Refer to xref:compose-configuration/field-types.adoc[module field type reference] for details.

| [#module-field-expr]#<<module-field-expr,Field expressions>>#
|
Field expressions allow you to define a formula (calculated) field.
When a field defines an expression, the value is updated by the system when the result of the expression changes.

[CAUTION]
====
The value of a formula field can not be manually changed.
====

Click on the btn:[settings icon] next to the field type and navigate to the "General" tab.
Check the "field value expression" checkbox and insert the formula into the new input box.

Refer to the <<field-expressions,field expressions>> for more details.

[#page-builder]
== Page builder

[IMPORTANT]
====
If all page blocks are on the same y-axis (one single row), the page will stretch the blocks to fill the entire page.
This is useful when creating record or list pages with a single page block that should span the entire page.

image:compose-configuration/page-resize-config.png[width="49%"]
image:compose-configuration/page-resize-view.png[width="49%"]

====

The page builder is used to define the pages' structure using *page blocks* and a drag-and-drop interface.
Each page has a grid of 12 columns and is not limited vertically.

image::compose-configuration/page-builder-empty.png[role="data-zoomable"]

Click on the btn:[+ Add block] button to open the page block picker where you can configure and add a new page block.
The entire page block reference is available xref:compose-configuration/page-blocks.adoc[here].

image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-picker.png[role="data-zoomable"]

When you configure and save a page block it is added to the page.

image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-base.png[role="data-zoomable"]

To reposition the page block, simply drag-and-drop it to the desired position.

The page block may be placed anywhere on the x-axis, but its y-axis must connect with another page block or with the top of the page.
If the position is not valid, or it overlays with another page block, the page builder may automatically adjust the surrounding page blocks to conform to the constraints.

image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-base.png[role="data-zoomable"]
image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-repos.png[role="data-zoomable"]

To resize the page block, simply grab the arrow in the bottom-right corner and resize to your needs.
The page block may not exceed the maximum width of 12 columns.
The height is not limited.

image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-base.png[role="data-zoomable"]
image::compose-configuration/page-builder-block-resize.png[role="data-zoomable"]

By placing a few extra blocks and changing their layout, you can create interesting home pages and dashboards like the CRM's.

[#copying-list-pages]
== Copying list pages

The option to save a list page as copy allows us to create a new page that contains the same page blocks as another list page.
This is very useful because instead of re-adding the same page blocks from another page, they can be copied simply by pressing a button.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Only page lists can be copied. Record pages cannot be saved as copies.
====

To copy the contents of another list page, navigate to the page itself and click on the btn:[Save as copy].

== Configuring Page Icons

Page icons can be set to list or record pages.
This gives us the ability to further customize a page and easily distinguish it from other pages.

To set the page icon, inside your namespace, navigate to the menu:admin panel[pages], and edit the page you wish to set the icon for.
Find the page icon section under the page description and click on the btn:[edit] button.

[#field-expressions]
== Field expressions

[#value-expressions]
=== Value expressions

Value expressions calculate the fields' value based on the provided expression.
A value expression is a simple expression that results in a single value.
If your field is a multi-value field, you need to return an array of items.

Refer to the xref:expr/index.adoc[] for details on writing expressions.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Currently, you can only use values of the current record.
References are not yet supported.
If you need to reference data across multiple records, resort to using an xref:automation/index.adoc[automation] instead.
====

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#values-ctx-old]#<<values-ctx-old,`old`>>#
|
The `old` variable refers to the original record.
Only set when the field is being updated.

| [#values-ctx-new]#<<values-ctx-new,`new`>>#
|
The `new` variable refers to the current record.

| [#values-ctx-value]#<<values-ctx-value,`<field-name>`>>#
|
A string or an array of strings with current field values.
If the field name collides with any of the system-defined variables, access the value via the <<values-ctx-new,new["field_name_here"]>>.

|===

.Example expression that calculates the price with tax:
[source]
----
price * 1.25
----

.Example expression that generates a full name:
[source]
----
trim(firstName + " " + lastName)
----

.Example expression of a multi-value expression evaluation:
[source]
----
["foo", "bar", "baz"]
----

[#value-sanitizers]
=== Sanitizers

Sanitizers modify the field value to cleanup (sanitize) the data before it is saved.
A sanitizer is a simple expression that results in a single value.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Sanitizers are ran multiple times, once before data is sent to event bus (corredor and workflows) and the second is right before the record is sent to the API.
====

Refer to the xref:expr/index.adoc[] for details on writing expressions.

By their nature, sanitizers *should not* result in an error.
If an error occurs, it is logged in the action log, and the operation continues.

If you define multiple sanitizers, they are run in the specified order.

.Example sanitizer that limits the text length:
[source]
----
length(value) > 5 ? substr(value, 0, 5) + "..." : value
----

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#sanitizer-ctx-value]#<<sanitizer-ctx-value,`value`>>#
|
The `value` variable refers to the current value.

|===

[#value-validators]
=== Validators

Validators validate the field value by raising errors when the value is not valid.
A validator is a simple expression that results in a single value, either `true` or `false`.
The value validation is considered invalid when the expression results in `true`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Validators can not change the field's value.
====

Built-in field validators can be disabled; required and unique-multi-value validators can not be disabled.

If you define multiple validators, they are run in the specified order.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The field validator stops when the first error occurs.
For example, if we define validators `A`, `B`, and `C`, and the validator `A` raises an error, validators `B` and `C` are not evaluated.
====

.Validation expressions are not executed when:
* the value is not changed,
* the value is missing.

[TIP]
====
Use the required flag to check for required values.
====

.Available variables in the evaluation context:
[cols="1s,5a"]
|===

| [#validator-ctx-value]#<<validator-ctx-value,`value`>>#
|
The `value` variable refers to the current value.

| [#validator-ctx-oldvalue]#<<validator-ctx-oldvalue,`oldValue`>>#
|
The `oldValue` variable refers to the original value.
Only set when the field is being updated.

| [#validator-ctx-values]#<<validator-ctx-values,`values`>>#
|
The `values` variable refers to all record values (`values.<field-name>`).
You can use this to create context-aware validators.

|===

.Example validator to check the text length:
[source]
----
length(title) < 5

== Page Block Magnification

Page blocks have a magnification option that allows the user to inspect the details of the block in distraction-free mode.
By default, block magnification is disabled.
When set, blocks that have this configuration will have a zoom-in icon in the top right corner of the block, allowing the user to magnify the block upon clicking on the icon.

== Page Block Refresh

Page blocks have a refresh option to automatically renew their data without having to reload the entire page, this is useful for page blocks that display data that changes frequently, such as a list of new leads, an update to a chart, or a list of recent comments.

[NOTE]
====
Automation, file, content, nylas, navigation, and geometry blocks do not have the refresh option.
====

=== Enabling Auto-Refresh

When enabled, page blocks that have this configuration will automatically refresh based on an interval.
To enable auto-refresh, navigate to the page builder, choose a block that supports refresh, and go to its general tab.
There you will find the refresh option.

      "w": 550,
      "h": 100,
      "kind": "box"
    }
  ]
}
----

You'll want to enter a value expressed in seconds into the input above the *Show refresh button* toggle, click save and close, save the page and you should see the block start to refresh when your interval elapses.

The lowest interval allowed is 5 seconds. 
To turn auto-refresh off on a block, you need to set its value to 0.

=== Enabling Manual Refresh

To enable manual refresh, navigate to the page builder, choose a block that supports refresh, and go to its general tab.
There you will find a toggle as highlighted below.
Switch it on.
