.If you can't see your automation scripts:
* make sure there were no compilation errors,
* you refreshed your page after you've added the scripts,
* the trigger defined a `.uiProp('app', 'compose')` constraint.

A *calendar page block* allows you to show events from different event sources in a calendar.

image:compose/pageblock-config-calendar-base.png[...,49%,role="preview data-zoomable"]
image:compose/pageblock-config-calendar-es.png[...,49%,role="preview data-zoomable"]

.Supported calendar views:
* month view,
* week view,
* day view,
* agenda view.

Calendar page blocks support two event sources: *reminders* and *records*.

The *reminders* event source allows you to show your reminders as a calendar event.

The *records* event source allows you to show a record as a calendar event.
This allows you to have a module for storing tasks which you can then show on the calendar.

[TIP]
====
When using records, you can define a pre-filter, allowing you to show only specific records.
Refer to the xref:accessing-corteza/ql.adoc[QL reference] for details.

[TIP]
====
The calendar page block pre-filter supports value interpolation.
