[#page-block-calendar]
== Calendar

A *calendar page block* allows you to show events from different event sources in a calendar.

image:compose-configuration/page-block-reference/config-calendar-es.png[...,49%,role="preview data-zoomable"]

.Supported calendar views:
* month view
* week view
* day view
* agenda view

Calendar page blocks support two event sources; *reminders* and *records*.

The *reminders* event source allows you to show your reminders as a calendar event.

The *records* event source allows you to show a record as a calendar event.
This allows you to have a module for storing tasks which you can then show on the calendar.

[TIP]
====
When using records, you can define a pre-filter, which allows you to show only specific records.
