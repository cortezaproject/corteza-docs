[#page-block-automation]
== Automation

The automation page block allows you to show xref:automation/index.adoc#automation-application-general[automation with manual triggers].

image::compose-configuration/page-block-reference/config-automation.png[...,50%,role="preview data-zoomable"]

The automation page block allows you to use both xref:automation/automation-scripts/index.adoc[automation scripts] and xref:automation/workflows/index.adoc[workflows].

.If you can't see your automation scripts make sure:
* there were no compilation errors,
* you refreshed your page after you've added the scripts,
* the trigger defined a `.uiProp('app', 'compose')` constraint.

.If you can't see your workflows make sure:
* there are no errors in the workflow,
* the workflow has an `onManual` trigger,
* the workflow is enabled.

[#page-block-calendar]
== Calendar

A *calendar page block* allows you to show events from different event sources in a calendar.

image:compose-configuration/page-block-reference/config-calendar-base.png[...,49%,role="preview data-zoomable"]
image:compose-configuration/page-block-reference/config-calendar-es.png[...,49%,role="preview data-zoomable"]

.Supported calendar views:
* month view
* week view
* day view
* agenda view

Calendar page blocks support two event sources; *reminders* and *records*.

The *reminders* event source allows you to show your reminders as a calendar event.

The *records* event source allows you to show a record as a calendar event.
This allows you to have a module for storing tasks which you can then show on the calendar.

[TIP]
====
When using records, you can define a pre-filter, which allows you to show only specific records.
Refer to the xref:accessing-corteza/ql.adoc[QL reference] for details.
====

[TIP]
====
The calendar page block pre-filter supports value interpolation.
====

[#page-block-chart]
