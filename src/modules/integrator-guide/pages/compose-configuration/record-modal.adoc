= Opening Records in Modal Windows

Record list, Calendar and Record page blocks have an option to open records in a modal window.
By default, records are opened in a new page.
When set, this option allows users to inspect specific records, while staying on the original page.

== Configuring the Option

To enable the option of opening records in a modal, navigate to the page builder, choose the record list block and go to its record list tab.
Scroll down to the Records section and you will find the option in the "On record click" select dropdown.
