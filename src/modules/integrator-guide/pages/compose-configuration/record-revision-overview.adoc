= Record Revisions

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides a record revision feature which allows you to configure modules to track changes on records by introducing a new revision counter and providing a histroy of changes.
{PRODUCT_NAME} keeps a revision counter for each record (starting from 1) that increments every time the record is updated, and only changes in record values are stored for each revision.

Revisions need to be enabled for a specific module and can be viewed inside of a record revision page block.
When enabled, all record changes are stored in the database with the author and the timestamp.

[NOTE]
====
A revision is only added when a record is updated, so newly created records don't have revisions.
This intentionally reduces the number of revisions that need to be kept.
