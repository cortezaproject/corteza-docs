= Record revision extension

Corteza provides a record revision extension which allows you to configure modules to track changes on records.
The record revisions feature can be accessed from the modules page block, which can be configured by enabling the record revision checkbox and declaring an identifier which repersents the name of the database table or collection where revisions records can be accessed and stored.
The revisions can be accessed from the record page block.

This extension provides revision support so that history is tracked through extending records and adding a "revision" system field. 
{PRODUCT_NAME} keeps a revision counter for each record (starting from 1) that increments every time the record is updated, and only changes in record values are stored for each revision.

When enabled, all record operations are stored in the database.
All record changes are stored with an author and timestamp and can be accessed from the Compose.

[NOTE]
====
A revision is only added when a record is updated, so newly created records don't have revisions. This intentionally reduces the number of revisions that need to be kept.
