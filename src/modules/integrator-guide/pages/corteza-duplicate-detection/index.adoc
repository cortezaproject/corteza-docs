:description: Learn how to USE {PRODUCT_NAME} duplicate detection to maintain clean and accurate data.

{PRODUCT_NAME} through the Duplicate detection feature helps maintain clean and accurate data. {PRODUCT_NAME} gives you tools for managing duplicates one at a time and across your organization, and to track your progress in eliminating duplicates.

[NOTE]
The duplicate detection feature can be used in  creating or editing a record, on existing records, importing records, etc. 

There are two main distinctive Categories:
    
    * on creating and updating a record/records (active duplicate detection)
    * on checking for duplicates on existing records
    
=== Duplicate Detection and Handling Process

{PRODUCT_NAME} finds and handles duplicates using a combination of matching rules and duplicate rules. Duplicate rules and duplicate jobs specify matching rules that determine how duplicates are identified. Duplicate sets and reports list the duplicates found.

* Detection Rule - A collection of matching rules

* Matching Rule - A combination of a matching field, matching method and matching value

* Matching Field - A field selected for detecting  duplicates

* Matching Value - A value definition used to compare(match) with other values

* Matching Method - How to compare a value with the matching value

=== Customize Duplicate Management

Configure duplicate management to align with other customizations you make and detect duplicates missed by standard rules. 

Customize the user interface for handling duplicates: For example, block users from creating duplicates instead of just warning them, or run different duplicate rules for different user profiles. 

Customize the logic used to identify duplicates: For example, include a custom field in a matching rule, specify field mapping, or customize matching criteria on fields.

// All duplicate detection jobs use pre-defined rules often referred to as **Duplicate Detection Rules** when searching for duplicates. These rules have single or multiple combinations of selecting the data entities referred to as **Criteria**, fields and defining constraints on selecting values under each.
