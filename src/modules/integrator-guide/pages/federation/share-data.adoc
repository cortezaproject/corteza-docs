When two nodes have *successfully performed the <<node-pairing,node pairing>>* process, we can *share the data between the two nodes*.

[NOTE]
====
Shared modules are created by the {APP_NAME_FEDERATION} system and can not be manually removed or updated.

[#expose-module]
== Sharing data

An *origin node* can *share data* with it's *paired destination nodes*.

An origin node *defines what modules* a specific destination node is *allowed to access*.

[NOTE]
====
You can only share data with nodes that have been successfully paired.
====

.To share a new module:
. navigate to {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE},
. enter the namespace administration area,
. navigate to the "Modules" sub-page,
. click on the edit icon next to the module you wish to share,
. click on "Federation Settings",
. go to the "Expose" tab,
. select a node you wish to share the module to,
. select the fields you wish to share with the module,
. save the changes.

[TIP]
====
You can copy "Exposed" settings from other nodes by selecting the desired node from the "Copy settings from" dropdown.

== Consume shared data

A *destination node* can *consume shared data* from it's *paired origin node*.

A destination node *defines what modules* it wishes to access and how *values map in the destination module*.

[NOTE]
====
You can only consume data from nodes that we successfully paired.
====

.Consuming data:
. navigate to {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE},
. enter the namespace administration area,
. navigate to the "Modules" subpage,
. click on the edit icon next to the module you wish to consume data into,
. click on "Federation Settings",
. go to the "Map" tab,
. select a node you wish to consume the data from,
. select what shared fields map into what module fields,
. save the changes.
