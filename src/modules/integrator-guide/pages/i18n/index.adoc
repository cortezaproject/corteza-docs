:description: Learn how to internationalize {PRODUCT_NAME}

{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to fully translate most aspect of the system.
{PRODUCT_NAME} provides two facilities dedicated to internationalization -- xref:i18n/static.adoc[static translations] and xref:i18n/resource.adoc[resource translations].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although you are able to define and translate into any language, some language specific use cases, are not yet fully supported.
====

A xref:i18n/static.adoc[*static translation*] is any piece of content defined on the system level and can not be modified neither from the system setup nor the configuration process.
Static translations are button labels, system page titles, and error messages.

A xref:i18n/resource.adoc[*resource translation*] is any piece of {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} content which is defined by an administrator when configuring the {PRODUCT_NAME} instance.
Resource translations are module names, {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} page titles, and namespace names.
