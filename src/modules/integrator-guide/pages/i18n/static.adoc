A *static translation* is any piece of content defined on the system level and can not be modified neither from the system setup nor the configuration process.

Static translations are button labels, system page titles, and error messages.

Refer to xref:i18n/resource.adoc[resource translations] to learn how to translate configurable content.

== Modify static translations

=== Fork the corteza-locale repository

The https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-locale[corteza-locale] repository provides a centralized storage for all translations used by {PRODUCT_NAME}.

You can use the repository in question as a base when defining additional languages or modifying existing translations.

=== Modify the translations

All of the translations are located in the `src` directory of the corteza-locale repository.
Translations are grouped by the *language*, and the *repository* that they are used in.

[CAUTION]
====
The language must be defined in the {PRODUCT_NAME} server configuration in order for it to be available.
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:i18n/index.adoc[DevOps guide] of details.
====

Refer to the <<translation-files,modifying translation files>> for details on how the resource files should be structured.

Refer to the <<languages,supporting new languages>> for details on how to define additional languages.

=== Deploying modified translations

Upload the modified translation files to your {PRODUCT_NAME} server.
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:i18n/index.adoc[DevOps guide] for details.

== Modifying translation files

.This is how the file structure of the corteza-locale repository looks like:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ <language tag> <1>
    üìÅ <corteza repository> <2>
      üìÑ <locale namespace file>.yaml <3>
----
<1> The directory must be named with the language tag of the contents.
The language tag must follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag[BCP-47] standard.
<2> The directory must be named the same as the repository in which it will be used in.
To examplify; translations used by {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} is named as `corteza-webapp-compose`.
<3> The file contains a series of translations that are grouped in a locale namespace.

[CAUTION]
====
Locale namespaces are *not* the same thing as {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} namespaces.
There is no correlation.
====

A locale namespace encapsulates content that falls into the common area, such as the sidebar, notifications, module fields.

[NOTE]
====
For the complete list of locale namespaces used by a specific web application take English translations as a reference.

[#languages]
== Supporting new languages

.This is how the file structure of the corteza-locale repository looks like:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ <language tag> <1>
----
<1> The directory must be named with the language tag of the contents.
The language tag must follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IETF_language_tag[BCP-47] standard.

To support an entirely new language, create a new directory in the `src` directory.
For example, to add Italian translations, you would need to create a directory named `it` in the `src` directory.

Languages can be defined using a simple language tag, such as `en` and `sl`.
If you need to be more specific you can use region suffix, such as `en-US` and `en-UK`.
{PRODUCT_NAME} will try to detect the language from the request headers and serve appropriate translation.

.An example file structure after adding the `it` folder:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ en <1>
  üìÅ it <2>
----
<1> This is the default directory with all of the English translations.
<2> This is the newly created directory for the Italian translations.

Inside the newly created directory create a `config.yaml` file.
The `config.yaml` file defines some base properties of the language, such as the display label (the `name` property).

Refer to the https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-locale/blob/{VERSION}/src/schema/config.json[`schema/config.json`] file for details.

.An example of the `config.yaml` file contents:
[source,yaml]
----
name: English
----

.An example file structure after adding `config.yaml` file:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ en
  üìÅ it
    üìÑ config.yaml <1>
----
<1> This is the configuration file that describes the given language.

After defining the boilerplate bits, refer to the predefined English translations (located in the `/src/en` directory) for all of the available translations.
