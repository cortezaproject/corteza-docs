= Integrator Guide

The integrator guide covers the process of extending {PRODUCT_NAME} to cover your business needs.
An integration can be as simple as the modification of the login screen to include your brand graphics, or as complex as the implementation of a completely custom {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} application.

This guide briefly goes over some administration aspects.
For a complete insight into system administration (roles and RBAC permissions) refer to the xref:administrator-guide:index.adoc[]

If you haven't yet setup your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance, refer to the xref:devops-guide:index.adoc[DevOps guide].

== The security model

For *authentication*, {PRODUCT_NAME} implements the OAuth2 protocol, where {PRODUCT_NAME} can act both as an OAuth2 client or as a server.
Refer to the xref:auth.adoc[authentication] section for details.

For *access control*, {PRODUCT_NAME} implements a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[RBAC facility] which allows you to fine tune access permissions to your needs.
Refer to the xref:security.adoc[security] section for details.

== Personalize the design

The login screen can be completely personalized to match your brand and give your users a piece of mind when entering their credentials.
Refer to the xref:personalization/auth.adoc[menu:personalization[authentication]] section for details.

[TIP]
====
It is a good idea to include your brand graphics where your {PRODUCT_NAME} instance will be accessed by external users.
====

To personalize other {PRODUCT_NAME} web applications, you need to do so in the source code and rebuild your custom web application manually.

*DevNote*: add some documentations about this.

== Access {PRODUCT_NAME} via the API

{PRODUCT_NAME} is API-centric, meaning that everything can be done via an API endpoint.
Refer to the xref:accessing-corteza/index.adoc[accessing {PRODUCT_NAME}] sections for details regarding xref:accessing-corteza/index.adoc#authentication[authentication], xref:accessing-corteza/index.adoc#api-endpoints[API endpoints], xref:accessing-corteza/index.adoc#response-format[data format], and the xref:accessing-corteza/ql.adoc[query language].

If you wish to connect an external application with {PRODUCT_NAME} in order to exchange data, you can use our xref:accessing-corteza/api-clients.adoc[Node.js API clients].

== Create a custom {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} app

To create your own {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} app is as easy as telling {PRODUCT_NAME} what data you wish to store, how the data is related, and how it should be displayed.

Refer to the xref:compose-configuration/index.adoc[{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration] to get the basic understanding of the different components, what they do and how they are configured.

Refer to the xref:compose-configuration/field-types.adoc[menu:{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration[module field types]] sub section for an overview of the supported field types and their configuration options.

Refer to the xref:compose-configuration/field-expr.adoc[menu:{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configuration[field expressions]] sub section to learn how you can define xref:compose-configuration/field-expr.adoc#value-expressions[value expressions (formula fields)], custom xref:compose-configuration/field-expr.adoc#value-sanitizers[value sanitizers] and xref:compose-configuration/field-expr.adoc#value-validators[validators].

== Automate your process

{PRODUCT_NAME} provides a powerful automation facility that allows you to implement nearly anything!
Automation is defined either via xref:workflows/index.adoc[workflows (menu:automation[workflow])] or xref:automation-scripts/index.adoc[automation scripts (menu:automation[automation script])].

A *workflow* is a simplified BPMN diagram, allowing you to describe the automation in a human-friendly manner.
A workflow is the recommended way to implement an automation as they are easier to read and maintain.

An *automation script* is a piece of JavaScript code that performs the desired operation.

[CAUTION]
====
If the automation requires multiple complex operations that are not natively supported by the workflow engine, an automation script may be a better choice.
====

== Create custom documents

[IMPORTANT]
====
To enable PDF document rendering, you will need to run the https://thecodingmachine.github.io/gotenberg/[gotenberg] Docker container.

*DevNote*: add instructions on how to setup.
====

{PRODUCT_NAME} defines a flexible template facility, allowing you to define custom documents (such as marketing emails and PDF quotes) that you will send to your contacts.
The template facility currently supports *PDF*, *HTML*, and *plain text* formats.

Refer to the xref:templates/index.adoc[templates] section to overview the process of defining a template and rendering a document.

[TIP]
====
You can request document rendering from external applications via the REST API.

*DevNote*: add a reference to the endpoint.
