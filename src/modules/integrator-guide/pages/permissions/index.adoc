= Permissions

Corteza's Role-based access control (RBAC) is a powerful feature that restricts access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. This ensures employees(user's) can only access information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

The new introduced interface comes with API endpoints that allows adminstrators to review users and combibation of their roles or what operations will be allowed or denied.
