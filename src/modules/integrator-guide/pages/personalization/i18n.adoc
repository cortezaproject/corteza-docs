{PRODUCT_NAME} allows you to fully translate most aspect of the system.
From the <<ui-translations,user interface>> to custom <<resource-translations,{APP_NAME_COMPOSE} configurations>> such as modules and their fields.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Although you are able to define and translate into any language, some of the more "exotic" cases, such as right-to-left, are not yet fully supported.
====

[#ui-translations]
== Customizing the user interface

=== Fork the corteza-locale repository

The https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-locale[corteza-locale] repository provides a centralized storage for all translations used by {PRODUCT_NAME}.

You can use the repository in question as a base when defining additional languages or modifying existing translations.

=== Modify the translations

All of the translations are located in the `src` directory of the corteza-locale repository.
Translations are grouped by the *language*, and the *repository* that they are used in.

[CAUTION]
====
The language must be defined in the {PRODUCT_NAME} server configuration in order for it to be available.
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:maintenance/i18n.adoc[DevOps guide] of details.
====

Refer to the <<translation-files,modifying translation files>> for details on how the resource files should be structured.

Refer to the <<languages,supporting new languages>> for details on how to define additional languages.

=== Deploying modified translations

Upload the modified translation files to your {PRODUCT_NAME} server.
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:maintenance/i18n.adoc[DevOps guide] for details.

[#resource-translations]
== Customize resource translations

In addition to user interface translations, {PRODUCT_NAME} also allows you to translate all of the custom {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} resources such as namespaces, modules, and module fields.

The interface can be accessed by clicking on the *language* image:personalization/language-solid.svg[width=20px] button when editing the resource that supports this feature.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* update {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} screenshots when the feature is fully merged.
====

[#translation-files]
== Modifying translation files

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:maintenance/i18n.adoc[DevOps guide] on how to deploy the changes.

.This is how the file structure of the corteza-locale repository looks like:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ <language tag> <1>
    üìÅ <corteza repository> <2>
      üìÑ <locale namespace file>.yaml <3>
----
<1> The directory must be named with the language tag of the contents.
The language tag must follow the BCP-47 standard.
<2> The directory must be named the same as the repository in which it will be used in.
To examplify; translations used by {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} is named as `corteza-webapp-compose`.
<3> The file contains a series of translations that are grouped in a locale namespace.

[CAUTION]
====
Locale namespaces are *not* the same thing as {PRODUCT_NAME} {APP_NAME_COMPOSE} namespaces.
There is no correlation.
====

A locale namespace encapsulates content that falls into the common area, such as the sidebar, notifications, module fields.

[NOTE]
====
*DevNote* define a complete list of namespaces and what contents they should hold?
====

[#languages]
== Supporting new languages

[NOTE]
====
Refer to the xref:devops-guide:maintenance/i18n.adoc[DevOps guide] on how to deploy the changes.
====

.This is how the file structure of the corteza-locale repository looks like:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ <language tag> <1>
----
<1> The directory must be named with the language tag of the contents.
The language tag must follow the BCP-47 standard.

To support an entirely new language, create a new directory in the `src` directory.
For example, to add Italian translations, you would need to create a directory named `it` in the `src` directory.

.An example file structure after adding the `it` folder:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ en <1>
  üìÅ it <2>
----
<1> This is the default directory with all of the English translations.
<2> This is the newly created directory for the Italian translations.

Inside the newly created directory create a `config.yaml` file.
The `config.yaml` file defines some base properties of the language, such as the display label (the `name` property).

Refer to the https://github.com/cortezaproject/corteza-locale/blob/22491ad6cb1a317efef9aed73dc94d68d367f6d5/src/schema/config.json[`schema/config.json`] file for details.

.An example of the `config.yaml` file contents:
[source,yaml]
----
name: English
----

.An example file structure after adding `config.yaml` file:
[source]
----
üìÅ src
  üìÅ en
  üìÅ it
    üìÑ config.yaml <1>
----
<1> This is the configuration file that describes the given language.

After defining the boilerplate bits, refer to the predefined English translations (located in the `/src/en` directory) for all of the available translations.
