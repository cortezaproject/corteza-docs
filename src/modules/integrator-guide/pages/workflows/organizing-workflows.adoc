= Organizing your workflows

A workflow can quite easily grow in size as the business grows, the client wants a change or the market changes.

To help you maintain and expand on larger projects, we've prepared a document outlining the xref:workflows/style-guide-best-practices.adoc[style guide and best practices].
In addition to the document, you can use the *swimlane* image:workflow/swimlane.svg[width=20px] visual element to group steps based on their purpose.

A swimlane image:workflow/swimlane.svg[width=20px] is a purely visual element and does not affect the execution of a workflow.
In smaller workflows that perform simple, singular operations (such as notifying administrator about a client sign-up or logging changes) swimlanes don't make much sense and may even reduce the clarity.
For larger projects however, swimlanes can be an orderly addition as they help you visually group smaller steps into larger operations and thus allowing you to understand what a specific part of the workflow does.

== Example

Lets first build a basic example.
On the case record page, we wish to have a button that changes the status of the case from pending to accepted.

.The workflow looks like this:
image:workflow/organizing-1.png[]

Let us expand the requirement by notifying the related client and the CRM administrator about the change.

.The workflow now looks like this:
image:workflow/organizing-2.png[]

Another great feature is the possibility of tracking the changes using an audit log.
To do this, you need to create a new record for the audit log module.


.The workflow now looks like this:
image:workflow/organizing-3.png[]

We could keep going, but I think we can already see that this will become unmaintainable in the future.
To help us group steps by their purpose by using a swimlane image:workflow/swimlane.svg[width=20px].

.Adding a few swimlanes and doing some reordering we get something like this:
