Server scripts::
    Automation scripts executed inside the {APP_AUTOMATION} server.

Triggers or Automation Triggers::
    A set of rules, constraints and options to define when, where and how an automation script is executed.

Event Type::
    Defines what event causes this automation script to execute.

Trigger constraints::
    A set of constraints that must be truthy for the automation script to be available and executable.

Trigger weight::
    Allows us to specify the order of automation script execution for the given event.

User interface properties or UIProps::
    Determine front-end aspects of the automation script invocation component; such as placement, label and colour (see UIHooks).

Explicitly triggered or manual scripts::
    Automation scripts that are executed explicitly, such as a button press or an API endpoint call.

Implicitly triggered scripts::
    Automation scripts that are executed implicitly as collateral to an event, such as record creation and form submission.

Deferred or scheduled scripts::
    Automation scripts that are executed at a specified time or on a configured interval.

// Batch or iterator scripts::
//     Automation scripts that are executed over a more extensive set of resources at the same time (used for batch processing).
// 
Sink scripts::
    Automation scripts that are executed on HTTP requests and allow the implementation of new endpoints.

Event bus::
    Event handling system inside client web applications and on the server.

UIHooks::
    Define front-end components that are used to execute explicit (manual) automation scripts (see UIProps).
