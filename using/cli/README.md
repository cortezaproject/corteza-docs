# Corteza Command Line Interface

## General

You can choose from one of the four (4) app/service CLI entrypoints:

 - system (`corteza-server-system`)
 - messaging (`corteza-server-messaging`)
 - compose (`corteza-server-compose`)
 - all-in-one monolith (`corteza-server`)

When the system is built into an all-in-one binary or image,
app-specific commands can be accessed under a sub-command with the
same name as the app.

## Config
Command and application behavior can be adjusted using environmental
variables. Defaults that are preset internally are optimized for production mode.

Make sure you read `/.env.example` for all the available options.

Note that defaults shown under `--help` are overridden by values from the accompanying environmental variable.

## How to run:

### Compile source files and run with `go run`

Source entrypoints can be found under `cmd/`:

```sh
go run cmd/system/*.go [commands and flags]
```

### Docker or Docker Compose

Docker images are built with handy presets for
`ENTRYPOINT` and `CMD`. By default, `CMD` is set to `serve-api`.

See docker manual for more info about ENTRYPOINT and CMD.

You can access Corteza's CLI environment through docker exec or run.
Corteza's binary is deployed into /bin directory inside the container and it varies for each build flavour:

 - `/bin/corteza-server-system` for system build
 - `/bin/corteza-server-messaging` for messaging build
 - `/bin/corteza-server-compose` for compose build
 - `/bin/corteza-server` for all-in-one monolith build

Running CLI for messaging build:
```sh
docker-compose exec server /bin/corteza-server-messaging --help
```

Running CLI for monolith build:
```sh
docker-compose exec server /bin/corteza-server --help
```

## Base commands:

These commands are accessible from the base level (never
wrapped under an app-sub-command) and always affect all apps.

### `provision`

Command `provision` Wraps 2 sub-commands:
 - `access-control-rules`
   Reset access control rules for Everyone and Administrator roles.
 - `migrate-database`
   Run database migration scripts

Both these commands are automatically executed when you run `serve-api` command after the database is connected and before initialization. This behavior can be changed with env variables.

You can prevent auto-provision on startup with `PROVISION_AUTO_SETUP=false`.
